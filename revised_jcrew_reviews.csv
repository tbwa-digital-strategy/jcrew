"j.crew is one of my absolute favorite brands. since starting grad school last year i’ve had to invest in a lot of professional clothing, and i love the style of j. crew, especially the classic pieces that everyone needs for staples! i also love the factory store for more casual clothes!"
their clothes have gotten really boring or weirdly baggy. i still love their business sheath dresses and suiting. the website has always been my primary way of purchasing and i have always had a good experience p. their customer service has always been great.
j crew is one of my favorite stores!! all of their clothing items are cute and classy! they are also made very well and hold up through wears and washes! they are a little on the pricier side but they are worth it and they also have good deals!
i love jcrew’s online store. they have so many options to choose from and they ship out super fast! 90% of my closet is full of their clothes. i almost always find the size i wear in their website. very happy with their online store.
amazing clothing. i love shopping here. quality of clothing is so amazing and so good. i love how comfy i feel in their brand. my favorite purchases from here would have to be for winter shopping. so soft and super warm winter clothes. i really love shopping with j crew either online or in store  they have such a great product line and a great pricing. i especially love that when something isn't right  so many employees  work with you to correct your decisions.
"i shop at j crew when i am looking for quality, classic clothing. i like that the crew cuts ships for free and i regularly find good deals in the clearance section. i recommend shopping here if looking for a quality product."
j. crew and j. crew factory always have a great selection of some of the cutest clothes! especially if you’re going for a preppy look. their quality isn’t quite as good as it used to be but they still have nice clothes!
"i enjoy shopping on jcrew.com, but prefer to be in store, especially in their outlet stores. it is easy to navigate and find great deals online, but i feel that their outlets offer better deals than their online clearance. j crew also has a mix of quality; some of their clothes are excellent and well made and some are not. online though it is hard to tell the difference and you may end up paying $60 for a glorified t-shirt."
"absolutely love j crew!  great deals on great clothes. always have a special or sale going on, so be on the lookout!  never pay full price!  quick shipping and easy return options. definitely my go to for clothes!"
"received some items as a gift. i tried to return, not for money but for a different size. i went through a mess with customer service. the quality of the clothes was good but not customer service."
"the shopping experience on jcrew's website is always easy and never a hassle. the best part is i've had so much in my shopping cart at one point (new job, new wardrobe) that they pre-approved me for a credit card without me even applying. they recognized that i love to shop there and offered me a reason to continue to do so. i love jcrew's online shopping experience."
"very user friendly with a clean, simple interface. it makes online shopping a breeze. j. crew has classic, crisp, clean lines and designs that are essential staples in any grounded wardrobe."
"j.crew never disappoints. here i am in a basic tee and my go-to pants for summer, which i share in detail on my blog b.e. style. they're clothes are true to size.i shop at j.crew factory often because the quality is great and the prices are super affordable."
"j crew doesn’t sell the most interesting or trendy pieces. but, they do sell quality, classic basics for work, which i why i continue to purchase pieces here. keep an eye out for their emails, as they do have flash sales quite often."
j.crew is a brand i know and trust and have shopped from for years. they make high quality clothing and accessories that perfectly suit my aesthetic. they are easy to shop from both in store and online and always have a wide variety of styles to choose from.
are you still love j.crew the clothes are not as good as they used to be. their jewelry used to be my favorite jewelry and even that has been lacking lately. i heard that they’re having a down spend with sales and i would think that they would have more sales or more incentives for their loyal faithful customers to come back.
"this is one of my favorite stores.  i love the styles, the colors and the selection that this store has.  i always get the flip flops here each season and have started getting a lot of great finds for my kids here.  i love the laid back, preppyish approach to this clothing line and there are typically a lot of items on sale.  i also enjoy the catalogs that get mailed out for this brand."
"i prefer their online store compared to their store front. i feel like i am able to find more online. they have great staple pieces that will last a long time for the price you. also, their sales section is great. i would recommend shopping here for a special occasion as well."
"shipping took a week longer than stated when i checked out. so the dress i bought for an event did not arrive in time. i am disappointed and didn’t get any reply from my email to them. i probably will shop them again, because i do like their clothing and they have good sales."
"jcrew is the best! the items are great quality, the sizing is easy, and they always have a great selection of classic flattering pieces for all ages, but also a nice selection of slightly trendy pieces too. the customer service is good and the return policy is good too."
since i was 20 years old which was 15 years ago i begin to absolutely fall in love with j.crew and that love has only grown so when i do have the money i will splurge and get myself an outfit here or there or something that i really had my eye on for a while from them.
"have shopped online here for years. sometimes you can find better deals online than you can in stores. a lot of times you can find things online that are not in the store too, which is great. they have great customer service and i’ll keep on online shopping here for sure"
i adore jcrew especially for their chino shorts. they are the perfect length on me for work and for school. they are such nice quality also. i love wearing them with their graphic tshirts that i also adore. they are so soft and never shrink in the wash.
i really like j crews style because they are casual but can also be interview appropriate with a slight change. they also offer 15% student discount if you show them your student id! when their products are on sale the price is usually reasonable too!
j.crew is for business wear and older people i feel. i have friends around 22 that wear it but it makes them look stuck up. the best part about shopping here is the quality of their clothes and they can make you look cute and business professional!
"i had a really great experience at jcrew.com - they purchasing process was easy and great. i got everything i needed and, more important for my wallet, nothing that i didn't! this website is much less overwhelming than others i have been shopping on."
"classic style, great fit, and so many choices. i love seeing styles put together on facebook and clicking on the link takes you straight to the site! clever!"
jcrew used to be great for sweaters and coats but i find lately the options are very limited and usually the same stuff over and over. however the quality of clothing justifies their prices better than most other brands in their range.
"i always find the best clothes for my job at jcrew! they not only have great professional wear, but they also have great sweaters and vest for the fall/winter time! i also love getting jewelry from jcrew, it is always great quality."
"i️ love j. crew, and shopping with them online is even better. you can always find their sales online as well. wonderful well made clothing that fits like a charm. they also offer discounts to students which i️ think is amazing."
jcrew is great because they have quality goods and consistent sizing. they regularly have online sales and have low free shipping thresholds that are easily met. return policies tend to be good on items that aren’t final sale.
i love the quality of their cloths and or shoes. . it is somehow affordable and worth the money coz it lasted for a while. i have cloths from them and it still looks great after several uses and i love it. you spend for quality.
i like j. crew and their clothes are really nice. very classy.  they last for so long.  a bit expensive comparing to other stores but it is worth it.  their styles are not the best.  a bit more toward the older generation than younger one.
"i ordered a maxi dress i saw online to wear to my niece's wedding. it was very reasonable and wow! so beautiful! not only that, but it fit like it was made for me and it had pockets!!! washed and dried it looks brand new."
j. crew used to be one of my all time favorite brands so i'm not sure if i just grew out of there style or if they have been changing it up over the last few years but i'm finding it harder an harder to relate to there style.
i normally go for the outlet stores but i love jcrew. i’ve gotten lots of great items like vests and clothing items. the quality never disappoints and the they have treat sales. defiantly recommend shopping here.
"a very preppy everyday wear brand, j crew has all the staples for any wardrobe ! a little on the expensive side however you can always find a good deal to add to your closet! i definitely recommend shopping here!"
i love shopping at j crew and their website is very easy to use and user friendly. i almost always find some sort of deal or coupon to use to shop their website and if you hit a minimum you usually get free shipping
"between silk scarves and statement jewelry, you cannot go wrong with accessory shopping at j. crew. the sales clerks and always helpful, giving such a nice shopping experience while finding all your new goodies!"
"i love all things jcrew, but more-so their factory outlet. i love the affordable, trendy options that can be incredibly versatile. i will continue to shop here for years to come, i haven’t been disappointed yet!"
such cute clothes and accessories! i love their clothes and it's so affordable for pretty and dressy clothes! love their coats and rain coats! got a bunch of stuff for christmas! i would recommend! great store
i like the jcrew website for the most part. the website design is very fresh and clean. the $5 flat rate shipping is great too & there is almost always a sale going on. the selection is not incredibly vast
i love looking through their website and then i want on a deal you just can’t pass up. they always have an extra percent off their sale items so if you find something you like wait a few days for the sale!
i’m addicted to jcrew jewelry it’s a big big problem i cannot check their site without checking out without less than 3-6 pairs of earrings always so unique and beautiful! i love their style and quality!
"jcrew is a must have in any closet. the pieces are great quality and affordable, especially during their great sales! the employees are always so helpful and i have never had a problem ordering online."
i recently bought my first pair of matchstick jeans. i had never tried them before. looked really great on. also bought a gray sweater with a cowl neck. beautiful. also bought a very feminine blouse.
jcrew has a lot of great high quality pieces i can wear at work or around town. i love the chino shorts. it is so easy to return orders if something doesn't fit or you aren't satisfied with a product
i love j. crew but their factory store bumps up its prices before they have sales so you think you are saving more. really you are just being conned. cute stuff though and good quality.
"i love jcrew.com but i'm actually more of a fan of jcrew factory. the clothing is more comfortable and everyday, but they both have a great return policy and clothing is great quality and stylish."
"i shop at madewell, which is the sister company of j. crew. certain items tend to be expensive but when they have sales, the deals are great and quality of the clothes are well-made."
"i love j crew’s clothes!! they are on the pricey side, but they are also great quality.  they also have great sales so make sure you hit up the sale rack while you’re shopping!"
"love their summer line of shorts and tiops as they fit my small 5'1"" build well. have purchased their chino shorts in every color especially when they have their summer sale"
j crew may be pricey but it’s always classic. you can find great business staples there at any time of the year. they also have a factory website for extra clearance deals.
this is an easy to understand website with some great products and deals. i’ve only used it once but i had a good overall experience and the clothes were high quality.
"j. crew is my sister and her husband's favorite store to shop at so every holiday or birthday this is the place i go! they have great, affordable, fashionable items!"
"one of my favorite stores ever. as a personal stylist, i’m always bringing my clients here. first, the product is great. from basics to fun pieces, you’ll always find something. the prices are just ok, but i will say the quality is great. half of my personal closet is jcrew (their blazers are my absolute favorite) but when it comes to clients, i’m able to find pieces for clients of all ages. not the mention, the customer service is awesome. i had a package that was never delivered (about $800 worth of stuff) and they refunded it! i was so grateful because it was for a client and i couldn’t ask the client to pay for a lost package and i woulda been bummed to be out that money - but they took care of it without a second thought. just one of the many reasons i’ll always return back."
"i love jcrew. it has amazing clothes that fit the business world and everyday wear. it is a little pricey, but the clothes are high quality and last a very long time. my favorite piece is the quilted vest. i own a couple and want it in every color. highly recommend clothing brand."
"j crew demonstrates that they are not capable to handle their business appropriately, and instead they think they can treat the clients according to what they cannot manage."
"i recently started shopping at j.crew and j.crew factory, and i’m wondering why i never started shopping there earlier! they have the cutest clothes for men and women. their regular retail store (just j. crew) can get a little pricey, but j.crew factory totally makes up for it. the reason why i took a star off is because of the price, but the quality is very good for what you pay for. i do find that you can find similar styles of clothing at stores like h&m; i still really like the variety of options that j. crew had offer!"
i find j. crew both store and online to have some of the best customer service i have experienced from a store. i was having issues finding something in the store and with very little description they were able to help me find the right item. they actually had it pulled from a store and sent to me. i find with j. crew online i can order stuff i have tried on before if i want a different colour or something but i am a person i have to try new items on so that is a downside.
"as a girl with an hourglass shape, i've never seemed to find the right fit at jcrew for clothes, as much as i love the style and their branding. but i adore the accessories! i've found the cutest statement necklaces - they really make a classic outfit pop with flair! i've always enjoyed how cleanly and organized the shops are. the website is easy to navigate, too. it never seems like the sales are that great of discounts, but i appreciate a little off whenever i can get it!"
"simply chic, classy and fabulous. from finding business attire to fun leisure attire, j. crew is the place to go. it can become expensive. i found a pair of shoes i'd fallen in love with where i would have spent a bit more money on because the material was nice but the price was outrageous. however,'on the contrary, my sis found a beautiful pair of hunter green rain booties for such an affordable price!! their sales are always great and clothes are always cute and classy."
"their women's chino shorts are my favorite shorts in the world. i am a very petite female and their sizes are true to fit. typically when i try on size zero or small shorts they tend to be loose on my waist or be too short, or they are just not good quality. however, jcrew offers the best quality shorts i have ever had. they never ride up and look appropriate in any type of shorts wearing environment. they also do not suffocate your bottom."
"i love j crew for simple, classic, yet modern basics.  the quality of the clothing is usually great, although i've had some more quality control problems than usual lately (shirts tearing after a few washes).  but overall, its very easy to go into this store and have a whole new, cute wardrobe"
"my #1 favorite store. i shop both the regular j.crew store in addition to the jcrew factory store (online and the outlet location). i find that the regular j.crew is getting very pricy, but items are of good quality and its great to get staples there. the jcrew factory items are not as high of quality, but i love to shop and get new pieces each season, so i dont mind if they are more affordable but don't last as long."
"as an elementary school teacher, i strive to find clothes that are classic, professional and comfortably low maintenance. i am able to find all of these requirements on the racks of j. crew. the design of clothes and shoes they carry are a successful blending of modern and timeless. i have blazers and shoes i've had and worn for years. and they've withstood the test of time in both, style and quality."
i lived in jcrew when i worked there. they clothing is made of great quality materials and holds up very well. some people thinks it's on the pricier side of things which can be true but honestly there is always a deal and it's so worth it for both statement and staple prices that will last for years! i still have a dress that looks brand new from when i worked there 8 years ago!
"love the style and it’s my favorite store to shop. the quality is pretty good, long lasting. i definitely shop here a lot since i like that you can easily dress up or down the pieces and that’s very convenient. i love their statement pieces, like my chateau parka which i think will continue to be one of my fave items in my wardrobe."
"this is my go to preppy work place teacher office country club attire and i also spend a ridiculous amount on sweaters and pants here. the coats are amazing, the fabric is beautiful and the quality is there! i love stocking up each year on the martie pants and the accessories are amazing. high price tag but your paying for the fit and quality of the materials"
"i am a fan of jcrew and i do think they have quality pieces. i don't think their shipping/return polices are as easy as other brands, but i do shop their a lot. i would say the pros are the pieces, the cons are the prices. if you can get things on the sale, that is great, however full prices items are a bit hefty. overall, however, i love their style."
"love love love. and even better is jcrewfactory.com. they have really great staple pieces at reasonable prices. i also happen to think that their coats and shoes are some of their best items. the colors they offer for coats are really different than your run of the mill winter peacoats, and their shoes are really comfortable and durable."
"j crew is yet another store with suburb clothing and classy styles.   i love how j crew can take a classic look and add a few accent pieces that make it look oh, so trendy.   i love shopping in places where everything is organized and upbeat.   j crew is a store in person or online that will meet your needs for a day at work or a weekend picnic."
"as much as i love the clothing from j.crew. the customer service is not very helpful, the few times i have shopped their i didn't get any help from the employees. i asked for a pair of shoes and they never showed up with my shoes and the items i had on hold at the cash register were returned to the racks. i was really disappointed!"
"great sales. the standard pieces can be picked up for very cheap when they go on sale. everything is well made and the website is easy to navigate. i am always checking to see what they have and making a list of the things i want. i would recommend for someone getting out of the cheaper brands, but want to stay classic and fun"
"okay i like j.crew items but i hate if you buy something, the next week it's on sale. then a month later it's in the outlet. i just like knowing i am getting a product i like at the best available price. i hate they don't do any price adjustments! it's like they make you pay too much or risk selling out in your size :("
"j.crew is a great clothing store found in most malls with a wide selection of current fashionable clothing. they have a great selection of men's clothing, however, the pricing is not always the best. they are by no means  expensive, and do provide great value, but could be a little cheaper. overall, a great store!"
"i will always love jcrew for the style of clothing, colors, how versatile the fashions are, and the customer service. i will say it makes me a tad frustrated that they don't carry larger sizes in short for the legs. i'm bit bigger in my legs and i can never fit in the legs of their shorts, but i love shopping everything else by them!"
i love j crew . prices are a little on the high side but you get what you pay for. the fit and quality of their clothing is excellent and there is a good variety for men and women . i like them so much i got their store card!
"i always look forward to the online promotions and store sales. from style to quality to statement pieces galaore, i love jcrew. half my wardrobe is jcrew and i will keep it that way. i would definitely recommend this company."
"another one of my favorite stores! everything about j. crew is classy, elegant, and timeless. i love that every piece i buy from j. crew will last forever, and i find it easy to mix these staples with other pieces in my wardrobe. i also love that you can find everything from work clothes to date-night outfits in one place."
i love jcrew. i like how they take simple designs and use great colors. the only issue with shopping online is shipping cost and things constantly selling out. they do offer a lot of great promos though so i always keep an eye out. you can ship to store for free which is nice but sometimes you just want it shipped.
j. crew has such great preppy style. i love their basics! they also have. a great twist on fashion. i love shopping at j crew and their factory store. i do shop at both but more at the factory store because the retail store tends to be more on the pricey side. but great items at both stores regaurdless of price
jcrew is my go to store for jeans. they have a great selection of pretty much any kind of jeans you could wish for. large dressing rooms for trying on them to and to me that a plus.the sales people don't stare at you when you shop witch is always a plus for me. the jeans are high quality and lasts a long time.
i like j.crew's website. i often shop their sales because it can be expensive. their clothing is youthful but good quality.  their accessories are beautiful.i  enjoy my shopping experience online.  i will shop here again.
easy to use website- often has good sales. i wish they had more offers for free shipping. i was able to get two cute tops each for $15 recently. the bathing suits are really good quality. i will continue to shop here.
"comfortable and classic styles. very cute dresses.  i usually shop the sales, and have found really great deals. website is easy to navigate, and customer service is always good. good quality materials."
i love j crew but i typically only will buy something once it goes on sale. i love their t-shirts because they are made with the softest material. i also own several classic pencil skirts - they have a lot of timeless pieces that can last many seasons. j crew factory store has some great deals as well.
"i am a teacher and i love that j.crew offers a teacher discount. (and a student discount for when i was back in college.) their clothing can be staples in your collection and they have classic and timeless pieces that won't go out of style. i usually come here when i'm shopping for my ""teacher clothes""."
"this website is so easy to navigate and it seems as though they're always having additional 30-40% off current sales. i'm a sucker for sales and i love their sophisticated casual look. i have a duffle jacket from, i don't even know how long ago - maybe 4/5 years, and it still looks just as gorgeous as when i bought it."
"best place to shop for preppy, trendy clothing, shoes, and accessories. favorite purchase ever has to be between a bunch of things such as their beautiful silk scarves, ruffle tops, espadrilles, and currently denim shorts! i would recommend shopping here especially when items are on sale!"
i normally shop at j crew factory and don't notice a huge difference from their regular j crew merchandise.  it's super affordable for good clothes.  love the preppy styles and cute home items.  i usually purchase things that are clearance with an extra discount on top for maximum savings!
"i bought a suit online for a job interview. i double-checked my measurements before ordering, only to end up with a skirt that was still a little too big in the waist. the jacket fit like a dream, though, and the material was very nice. in the future, i'll have to remember to size down."
"j. crew is my favorite store. that being said, it is also out of my price range. i love shopping at jcrew.com because i can find the best deals and look at the clearance clothing without searching through racks of disorganized clothes. usually i can find a free shipping code as well."
"when asked...if you could only shop at one store to buy all your clothes where would it be. jcrew would be my answer. i like the comfy, classic, chic collections that they have each season. my favorite timeless pieces are from jcrew and they somehow just get me when they design new collections."
"i like j.crew.  i'm a preppy/conservative dresser and love the fit of most of their clothes.  i will say their clothes are designed more for the petite frame, nevertheless, they are one of my favorite.  i love my black sweater from there - it's my one and only go to."
"i love jcrew. their webpage is easy navigation, easy purchase, and easy help support. their clothing is the main reason we go too their page, so i have to rave about their cloths, jcrew have some of the best winter cloths on the market. its warm, high quality, and looks great."
"i love j.crew, and i've actually ordered from their website twice in the past month. if you are signed up for their emails, you will get notified about different sales and promotions they do, and it can save you a lot of money! shipments always come so quickly, and i've never had a problem!"
"some of my favorite products to buy from j crew are their sweaters. i do think that their products may be slightly over priced. however, the sweaters at least are good quality, fit well, are comfortable and look good on pretty much everyone so i would recommend checking them out."
"j. crew is not really my style of clothing, but sometimes you can find some items that are a little different than their cookie cutter prep that they mostly stock. they have pretty good sales online too! the quality of clothing is pretty good though so if you can find something you like, then it can be worth the price."
my absolute favorite store. i always say they mix classic with trendy and chic on a daily basis. this is the place to shop for your basic pieces but also shop for the pieces that every gal stops you to ask where you got it from. i always go back - and they run occasional sales!
i liek j crew's style but i often cannot afford it. i window shop this store more than anything for the style inspiration. i buy jewelry on sale here occassionally. and i do check their sales but even those can be quite expensive. i wish there was a lower brand alternative.
i love purchasing items from them .this company offer a variety of clothes and styles.  i find them to be very affordable. i would make sure to recommend this brand to everyone i know. they always seem to stay with the latest styles and trends. i will continue to buy from them.
"i think the have the nicest clothing ever. everything is just so classy and put together. they have very chic clothing. i will say the pricing is a bit high but it's great quality clothing that looks great, which is hard to find. always have great styles everyone will love."
"i love j crew especially j crew factory for all the sales they have! there is always a great selection and my favorite section is all the jewelry because it is so high quality. another great thing is if you go to the store and show a student id, you get a 15% off discount!"
"such a good product for my sensitive skin. bottle is really cute and nice to give as gift. is was so soothing to my poor over used skin. will buy lots again.  fantastic, garuntee to please! i hope they sell a bigger size in the future or gift sets! maybe expand on scents too."
oh jcrew i love you. your clothes are so traditional and have wearability for years to come. each piece of clothing is thoughtfully designed to be comfortable and cute. some items are pretty pricey but their clothes are worth it if you don't have to swap it out every yearly
"good place to shop for classic and timeless pieces.  not a place to go to if you are looking to stand out and wear something outrageous or radical. nice shopping environment - clean, good lighting, organized, pleasant.  shop here often.  will shop here again."
"people complain about j. crew for the prices but the quality of their clothes are great. i love their denim, accessories and blazers. if you want quality clothes that last long i suggest this store."
"love jcrew. i always feel like their clothing is classy and great for my work.  also, i feel like the clothes are always made from good material and doesn't shrink easily.  sure they can be price but you get better quality and you can always find a good sale."
"quick turn-around, great sales, great products. i’ve been shopping at j. crew for years and don’t planning on stopping anytime soon. good quality clothing and shoes that last! i always recommend j. crew to friends looking for something a little nicer for work or for fun."
"the quality of their clothing is amazing. i think some their items are a tad over priced but the sale section is great as well as their j. crew factory. i would rather pay more for something that is going to last like j.crew. everything is professional, classy, yet cute!"
"jcrew is a great place to buy the basic pieces and easy to return to store at any malls pretty much.  their brand really got a facelift 10 years ago and started doing better and better, almost going from a so so name brand to luxury quality items.  awesome job!"
"j.crew's products are very tailored towards the preppy older woman and man, but i often times find many products there that i like myself (being 24 years old). they have exceltonal quality, but oftentimes the cut of the garment is geared towards someone who is older."
"their quality has decreased greatly. clothes that my mom bought back in the day at j. crew are impeccable quality. no holes, no tears, no loose seams. my j. crew purchases? holes after 1 wash, loose seams everywhere. i literally have to throw it out after 5-6 months."
i like their stuff for the most part but i think some of their basic items are way overpriced for the quality. some of their items are definitely worth the cost. i try to shop basics at other places that are more affordable but i love the classic look of j.crew items.
"this store is the king of classic style meets basic chic. the clothing is very flattering to a straight figure and their a-line dresses help create a flattering figure for those ladies that could use some extra help, like me :) while pricy, their quality is very good."
i have been a fan of jcrew for many years. i think their style is very on point and i think the quality is usually very good. i think they are over priced and have no need to be but i do think they have some very unique items that you can't find anywhere else.
this brand is highly recommended in my eyes. although the full price items aren't affordable for most i personally love their sales making it more reasonable for the normal working class to afford.
jcrew is a top-notch company! ordering online from them is always very easy and successful for me. be sure to get on their email list because they are constantly running promotions and sales...even better!!! the quality of their items is always great in my opinion.
"jcrew is one of my favorite stores. not only does this store carry classic pieces that are perfect for all seasons, they also carry pieces that coordinate easily. i also like that jcrew has those quirky pieces and statement jewelry to make the classic pieces pop."
"the site layout makes it extremely easy to navigate. i shop here for myself, my husband, and our toddler daughter. it's a very simple shopping experience and the clothes are very good quality. i have been shopping here for over 20 years and don't plan on stopping!"
"i love purchasing from jcrew.com! it is always easy to find what i need and get ideas on how to style it. i am also always impressed with the sales, free shipping, and quality clothing that they offer! shipping is fast and their packing tape is adorable too!!"
"love jcrew and jcrew factory! very preppy chic at an affordable price. i shop here often and love the way all of the clothing fits and can transfer from season to season. great quality, and lasts for many seasons. will always shop here and always recommend!"
"okay, jcrew rocks, hands down. but shopping on j.crew online is so easy too. so often i can hit it at a time in which they have free shipping or a sale. i've also had great success with j.crew factory and purchased many an item through both websites."
"i shop from jcrew factory sometimes, and the clothes are pretty big misses sometimes when you shop online. the size chart is definitely off and the clothes are definitely off trend. i would definitely recommend buying in store if shopping at their outlet."
"jcrew has really great quality, especially for the price! their apparel holds up really well and and you order online you can either have it shipped to you or the store for pickup. they have a selection that caters to many different types of styles as well."
love shopping at j.crew online.  they're style guides are always on point and their fit charts never fail. their customer service is top notch if you need help with returns or problems with an order! i will always shop here in the foreseeable future!
i love the preppy look of the clothes and always have. prices are pretty high for bland not alot to it clothes and alit are dry clean only. clothes run on the small side.
"if i could afford my entire closet to be jcrew it would be. high quality clothing that fits my small frame with curves. their chino shorts are the only shorts that fit me well, i buy a new pair every summer for a fun new color, but they last forever !"
"just began working at jcrew, given an incredible employee discount. clothes from jcrew last a million and one years, no store makes th to the same quality any more and they're not too expensive. there are often sales to make a little more affordable."
jcrew is such a classic brand with well made products. everything is always so crisp and nice looking from jcrew. the clothes are affordable in addition to adorable! that's a winner in my book! for sure recommend shopping here for your entire family.
definitely need to check out the sale section before purchasing. rarely pay full price as sometimes the quality doesn't justify the price. overall great quality for sale prices. several pieces are styled in a timeless fashion and worth the investment.
"along with loft and ann taylor, one of the few places to find high quality and stylish teacher clothes that are appropriate for both the classroom and fun! higher price range than loft but still worth it for quality of clothing. i often stop here!"
"the j.crew online shopping experience is easy and convenient. website is nicely set up, and it is painless to return items in the store! love shopping online with this site, and highly recommend to anyone else who prefers trying clothes on at home!"
"they have their good seasons and their bad seasons. lately its been bad. i usually love the shoes, this year nothing interested me at all. love their petite clothing they definitely fit me great. just wish the style becomes as fun as it once was."
"i got my eyes on these as soon as i saw them first appeared on the website and finally purchased them with the new 30% discount. when i tried in the store, the sa insisted that i should go for 00, which is one size smaller than my typical 0 so that was what i bought on line. upon receiving and trying it on, i realized the shoulders were snug and i could barely fit anything under it, even thin garments (i had a strapless dress on when i tried it in the store). i've since exchanged for the 0 and it fits much better although the arms are slight long and the overall fit was a bit ""loose"". overall, i am very happy with it. i love the color, the softness of the material and the cute style without looking too girly. the color can go with so many things and the style is fresh and different. i plan on wearing it with dark indigo skinny jeans, bootie and stripe shirt (as in picture) or with a red tippy sweater."
shipping can sometimes take the full five days when it says 3 to 5 days however the shipping is packed well and the clothes are never wrinkle lee the website itself is very well organized easy to navigate and i love that the models have a great pose
"i use the website because i really dislike the service being rendered in the store. so when i go through the website i don't have to deal with the rude sales people, therefore i like using the website and  so far i haven't had any problems with it."
i've only been to j.crew once but i fell in love with this blue sweater! i would wear it everyday of the week bc it was cold outside and it kept me warm. their clothes are well made and i would recommend shopping there especially in the winter.
"jcrew.com is probably my most ordered from clothing website. they always have such great sales, especially for cardholders. the one downfall of this website is that it's $5.00 to return something by mail, compared to a lot of other retailers that do free returns."
"i don't know what's going in here. this brand  has been a mainstay in my wardrobe since i could buy anything in my own. now, they have taken a departure from their classic with a twist style and have become just another on of the many with cheap and trendy styles."
j.crew is one of my staple places to shop for wardrobe. they have such great casual look that can be used to dress up or dress down your outfit. overall the price they're pretty affordable and they usually have great sales going on. my all-time favorite is their jewelry and her shoes that are really trendy and add the perfect pop to any outfit.
they do a great job with online sales which i really appreciate. their website is really easy to shop and fun to browse. you can always return item to a store  which i also like. overall the product can be a bit expensive but the quality is great.
"i love all things j. crew. i just bought the cutest tops from the factory outlet, such a good price for the quality. the fit is a little large though. i usually wear a medium top, but the medium swallows me here. i always go down to a small."
"love this store! they have amazing sales and quality products! my favorite purchase is a hair clip i got, i actually bought 6 of them since they were on sale! great price, quality products and they wrap their products great for shipping!!!!"
the website is pretty great! the only downside is they don't have a very good system in place for sizing online. also i probably just shouldn't shop online because i have an athletic curvy build that doesn't fit most j-crew styles!
their quality is the best out there. the clothes is just gorgeous and i cannot stop going to their store. the only downfall i find is that it is very repetitive. but other than that just amazing. jewelry is one of their strongest factors.
obsessed. i love the sidewalk skirts; they're perfect for tossing on to go to the office or for brunch with the ladies. absolutely great quality - made to last. i purchased 4 different colors!!! i will absolutely be back to jcrew.
"jcrew is my go to for great quality pieces. they've got cozy sweaters in all weights and beautiful colors. sometimes a bit more expensive that other places, but the quality more than makes up for it because you'll have it in your closet forever. don't forget to check the sale/clearance online for even better deals on everything."
i am giving j. crew a 4 star rating strictly for their prices. i am a bargain hunter so i will load up at their outlet stores but not so much at the regular department store. their clothes are more business casual and are perfect for work. they also offer more laid back clothes such as shorts and tshirts for the weekends.
their quality is the best out there. the clothes is just gorgeous and i cannot stop going to their store. the only downfall i find is that it is very repetitive. but other than that just amazing. jewelry is one of their strongest factors.
"love love love j.crew. their stock of clothing has made a wonderful addition to my professional wardrobe. i don't shop here often, but the pieces i do have are staples and have lasted years in my workplace wardrobe. highly recommended"
easy to navigate website with quality clothing. the clothing is on the more expensive end of what i usually ship for but seems to be made well and lasts. i don't shop here too often but will do some shopping when there is a good sale.
"i love their sales, their clothes, their return policy is great too. i received clothes that were damaged and they immediately refunded my money to me before i even returned the item. they care about their customers and strive to please"
"i think a good 75% of my wardrobe is from j.crew. the quality is amazing, and when they have sales, it is incredibly affordable as well. the pieces are classic, feminine, at all so unique, and their statement jewelry is the best ever!"
i shop at j. crew for my whole family. the classic clothes they sell will never go out of style. the quality of the clothes are superb. it's affordable and they always have wonderful sales. i would definitely recommend shopping at j. crew!
ok so maybe it’s a lil expensive. but it’s so worth it. i bought my boys and i some jeans for christmas. let me just say they are so comfortable. and you can tell they will be long lasting. that’s especially good when you have boys.
"my boyfriend likes to buy work clothes from here, sometimes i choose a different store. j crew never disappoints, the clothing is durable but sometimes the staff is snotty. quality is key when shopping at j.crew! never disappointed"
this store has great quality! everything is worth it. especially their jewelry and clothes. my j crew items last me so many years and don't look old. you can get good deals on sale as well without hiring your bank account that much.
"classic staple pieces is what this company is good for. good quality, a little pricey. i normally try to shop the sale section. i really like their vests and shorts as they are great quality and last long. will shop here again."

love j.crew online. i usually get free shipping which is really great. they make it easy to return things either by mail or in the store. i buy clothes from jcrew and recently ordered some beauty products that i am excited to try.
i always shop on jcrew' website. i've never ever returned anything. their fabrics are quality. i love their denim and wool. they also make great quality shoes and bags. jcrew is an all around great place to shop season after season.
"jcrew.com and j.crew in general is a go-to for wardrobe staples. from shorts, skirts, sweaters to bathing suits and headbands, jcrew.com is my go to. they have a great return policy and phenomenal customer service. highly recommend!"
"recently, i've been showing off this great pair of 484 slim fit trousers that i got on sale for $17 during a j.crew sale online! everything i buy there fits me perfectly and it's the first place i go to when i wardrobe my clients."
i love j. crew online! there is not a j. crew location near me so i shop on the website.
"the only place i get my dress pants for work. they basically feel like i'm wearing leggings, it's absolutely fantastic. i look put together and professional, yet i am extremely comfortable all day. couldn't ask for more in a pair of pants!"
it seems like 90% on my wardrobe is from jcrew and i couldn’t be more pleased with everything i get from them. great quality and clothes that stay true to sizing. i always want a gift card for any birthday or christmas gift!
j crew is one of my favorite store. i don't think i've bought anything in person but often do i lines especially with their sales.  i have never had any issues and really love their products. i would definitely recommend them.
j crew has great quality clothes. i usually get my favorite gold sandals from here. it's a bit expensive but it's worth it. i don't shop often but i still like it very much. i will shop here again and recommend to anyone.
i love shopping at jcrew or the jcrew website. they always have cute clothes and great sales. the puffy vest is my favorite. i think i have it in every color. i love the quality of jcrew clothing. i highly recommend it.
i purchased two pairs of jeans from jcrew and they fit perfectly! they have sizes for short petite ladies like myself. i purchased them in sale and i get a lot of complaints. love jcrew and will definitely purchase more!
great store through the years but sometimes the clothes fit strangely across the board. i have grabbed 2 of the same size that fit differently. it is too expensive to have to spend time guessing about size and fit.
"i think j crew has cute clothes, but their prices are not very affordable. i prefer to shop at j crew factory. i wish j crew would widen their variety of clothing. it feels like everything looks the same year after year."
"i love his store so much. the styles are right up my alley. it is not very affordable, but the j crew outlet has a lot of good deals that are always going on. i love the trends this brand carries. very mature looking."
"j crew has the cutest designs of clothing and typically lots of options. however the price of the clothes is extremely high if you don't catch a sale. also, the clothes are definitely lower quality than what they used to be."
"purchased a ruffled wrap skirt from here once, beautiful skirt but pricey! it was worth it, fits nice and has held up though a few washes. love their style of clothing. preppy, pretty clothing !! would love to buy more"
i love this store! it is a little pricey but i always feel great in what i end up leaving with. i can find things for my whole family and i know the quality will be great for a lasting product. i will always come back!

"jcrew costumer service is always great online, it's a little expensive but i think it's worth it.  the quality is very good all the products really hold up well. the pros is the quality the cons is that it's expensive"
jcrew is full of classic clothing for the whole family. they run great sales frequently and have a wealth of pretty things to wear both on downtime and to work! i love the flexibility of what this store has to offer!
"great but sometimes bland.  definitely a good place to go for basics, but depending on the season, the clothes just aren't worth the price.  when the prints are really fun though, it can be worth it."
i love jcrew! i bought some shorts from them for the summer and they are perfect. some of their stuff is expensive but definitely worth shopping the sales. the website is also super convenient. will shop here again.
"my husband prefers only jcrew so we have it as a must go destination when we go shopping. it is an expensive brand but the outfits speak of style, class and perfection all sewn into one. so i'd definitely recommend it."
this product is great! i highly recommend to anyone that is looking! great product on and the value and quality are great. it’s easy and affordable. my friends love it and i love it so you should go and buy it (: !
"jcrew has fantastically drained clothing for men and women. their clothes are fabulous quality. some of their items are very overpriced, which is why i knocked them down one star. you're definitely paying for he brand!"
"classy, classic, trendy and high quality. long lasting clothing and accessories with a budget healthy price tag. i shop with j.crew both online and in the store and always find career and casual wear i love that lasts."
love their clothing! it is very stylish and always have the best selection. many many colors and different variety of clothes. it is ok the pricier side of the spectrum but still affordable especially with sales.
j crew.com is just as great as it is on the store! i believe they offer free shipping and free returns! you can also order online and pick it up in stores! very easy to access! would recommend the online store!
love their clothing! it is very stylish and always have the best selection. many many colors and different variety of clothes. it is ok the pricier side of the spectrum but still affordable especially with sales.
i love all of my outfits from jcrew! very rarely am i disappointed and i feel like you can always catch them with a big sale going on! their sale items are updated daily so rarely do i pay full price for an item!
"super 120s wool, that's all i have to say. by far the best for work attire. better than banana republics light weight wool. purchases normally made online because i don't like being pestered by the sales people."
"easy to navigate website. i feel like you can find much more online than you can in the stores. i used to be able to order from the sale section and return, but last i checked you could not. jcrew is my go to store."
"love shopping at jcrew.com. their jeans are so comfortable and they always have great sales. the prices aren't too bad, but i still try to wait for a sale to shop so i can get more for my money. i'll always shop here."
"i can't remember how many orders i've placed here! i keep a watch out for the best deals and sales, and can't help but spend more than i plan to. a great mix for business and casual clothes that are sure to go with anything."
"i love j crew clothes, the quality is great. price is high but they're good with sales. the designs are rather simple, but very nice and sturdy. they could be more fashion forward and adventurous with their designs."
cute clothes for classic preppy style. never goes out of style and is always a good option for most occasions. their factory or outlet is always having good sales and always good quality items. most pieces last me for years and years
my mom and i love this brand the quality of the clothes is great! my mom has had to call the company before to check if they have things at the manufacturer and they are always so polite and willing to help.
boyfriend loves this store and it is his go-to store for the basics such as chinos and tees. although more and more things are starting to get made in china versus other places. quality might be going downhill
"jcrew is my go to. always have an outfit in needing for work or a day out of town! love the quality of their clothes! so comfortable! shop here a lot and online, they ship items so fast! totally recommend!"
"i buy tons of stuff for my husband here. they have great sales, fast shipping, and tons of classic styles that he loves. they have great basics like tees, shorts, and jeans. he is always stylish and comfy!"
i love jcrew.com and the sales they are always running. i love that i can use my student discount and they make returns so easy. great quality products and well priced. will definitely keep shopping here.
"easy to navigate the site to find what i'm looking for. a bit pricey, but there are often sales and free shipping available. timeless, classic pieces for my wardrobe as well as some more fun/trendy pieces"
j. crew clothes fit so well and my size never varies in their clothing. this makes shopping j. crew online so easy because i never need to worry about returns! i also always know i'll be getting good quality items.
love the quality of j crew. i always find good quality stuff and good sizing. it's a bit expensive but the pieces last. perfect for young professional environment and over all more professional settings.
the store is more pricey that other stores but the quality of the clothes are worth the price. i only have their excursion vests and they are super good quality but i like the other clothes they have to.
we buy my step dads clothing from here and they are very good quality. his favorites are the cargo shorts. they are pricy but they last for sure! we would definitely recommend buying clothing from here.
"love this brand. they have impeccable products. i love their tops, dresses and skirts. they have a good variety of clothes. it's a lil pricey but you get value for money as it is a good quality product."
"perfect place to shop when we’re looking for a casual outfit, to the perfect office outfit. their quality of clothes is great and authentic. i love their accessories line, too! crew cuts is also awesome!"
absolutely love j crew online! they have great sales and sizing is accurately demonstrated. products are great quality and last through many washes. styles are always updating but also always classic!
they clothes and accessories are adorable and extremely wearable yet unique. each piece will go with just about anything while also making a statement. the products are a bit expensive for the quality.
i’ve bought jcrew products for years.  i had a boyfriend who loved jcrew.  the products are well made and stand up through time.  i would recommend jcrew and consider it an excellent brand.  well made clothing.
i love shopping for my kids on this website. i recently purchased their school clothes from here and the quality of the clothing is wonderful. and shipping was fast! i had my package within two days!
love this store!! pretty pricy but great quality. more east coast style but i love it. everyone is friendly and their style is adorable. recommend to friends and family. usually visit mall locations.
"j. crew can be a bit pricy, but the clothes are good quality, stylish, relatively timeless, and they have good sales with deep discounts.  i also find the sizing is a bit more consistent than some other retailers.  also like their collaborations with artisans and designers."
"the best part of j.crew.com is the fact that you can always get a superb discount with their online promos! i've gotten many beautiful pieces of clothing from them for well under cost! so, so worth it!"
"easy returns, and a vast selection. this is another store i stalk continuously. i love the selection and the constant sales they offer. and to make it even better making returns is a breeze."
"i have been shopping at j.crew since i was a teen and i still love it to this day. you can find beautiful pieces as well as simple, wardrobe staples. expensive but worth the splurge for great products."
"i really do like this store, their outlet has such a cool atmosphere with the light wood floors and furnishings. there shoes are super comfortable too! i definitely recommend waiting for sales though."
"jcrew always has great sales and classic items that last forever. i buy most of my work clothes online, especially skinny pants. i can't find any other brand that fits or is of better quality!"
such good quality! i love the products that come out of this store. i never have a problem with loose threads or any quality issues. a store you must visit when you're reaching your 20's
i had to exchange an item a couple months ago and he customer service was great. they made my experience really good and shipped me the right since right away and j received it very quick!
jcrew has some of the cutest clothes. they also have great sales and you can find some steals. my favorite purchase was one of their one piece swimming suits. super flattering and so so comfy.
i use their website mostly for kids clothing once or twice a year when they have an end of season sale. quality and styles r great. prices are not cheap even on sale but worth it for special items
jcrew has top quality and the classic look. the crewcuts is adorable; but not very affordable for kids that grow and change quickly. the jewelry and dresses are always my favorite finds.
"j crew makes the best sweaters, great quality, comfy, and warm. all their designs are super cute and they have a lot of nice colors to choose from. my latest obsession is j crew jewelry 🌺🌹"
"love their style, their quality and prices. i usually wait for good deals. a nice place if you like minimal clothing, good quality, nice materials. my favorite purchase were teddy sweaters, comfy and warm."
"i usually shop in the kids section or at the outlet stores because the regular stuff is too expensive for me. but it’s great quality clothes, so it’s worth it if you can afford it."
such phenomenal quality and variety. you pay for quality. love their style. i do shop a lot and love jcrew. shopping experience is always great. excellent quality and will shop again
this is my absolute favorite retail store. the credit card and rewards program is fantastic and i love the preppy style. i look forward to every box i receive from j. crew.
i️ love jcrew. i️ can’t stop shopping there. i️ know the fit of their clothes and what works for me. i’m a little concerned/interested to see where the new design team takes it.
this store is more on the pricey side but you will find quality products for a good price. i love how high end their products are and the fact that the quality outweighs the cost.
"i used to frequently shop online and in the store, but the prices have seemed to go up. the quality of clothing is normally pretty good. the clothes for kids is waaay over priced."
"j crew is another store that is great for trendy petites. it is so nice being able to find age appropriate clothes that fit my small frame. a bit pricey, but overall worth it."
"i really love shopping with j crew either online or in store - great product line, great pricing, really good value. i especially love that when something isn't right - they work with you to correct it and follow-up on feedback promptly. what's not to love"
j.crew online has some amazing deals!! i'm always happy with what i receive from them and the price i pay and the quality.  i would sign up from emails and watch their sales!
"i love going into jcrew and looking for clothes. they always have a large selection of clothes for kids, men, and women. and all the employees are super nice and helpful."
i much prefer the outlet online store but j crew is a great clothing shop- they last a long time and wash very well. they let you use a student or teacher discount as well.
love this store great stuff i absolutely adore the jewelry in this store my favorite thing to buy at jcrew. very affordable love i always recommend to friends and family
i love j.crew. everything i've ever purchased from here has been high quality and has lasted a long time. i love their classic look and the quality is exceptional.
"good everyday basics for the office. quality is decent. style has become somewhat boring, but can still usually find something, especially with the  frequent sales."
online or in store they always have what i'm looking for! love all the colors and prints! i go online 3 times a week! and love going in store to touch and try on!
the clothes are either a hit or miss for me. more expensive and sometimes not the best quality. sizing can be off on different items so be careful when purchasing.
"love love love their clothes! very cute and preppy. very expensive, though. i usually go to the outlets and that's where i get the bulk of my j. crew clothes from. they are great quality and last forever!"
"awesome store. on the conservative side. quality is incredible, and it costs a good penny. the cloths are expensive but it worth it to buy one nice top than 3-4 cheaper tops. these cloths last forever!"
i used to like their clothes better but they are starting to be good again. the quality is great and the clothes are different. you can find career clothes and fun clothes. they also have great accessories.
i love j. crew!! i've signed up for their emails so anytime there is a flash sale i'm notified immediately. the website it very user friendly making shopping online that much easier.
"i love love love shopping here. i get the cutest shorts, skirts, and dresses from here.  it's great for school, internship, or working. i'll continue to buy here even though it's expensive."
"i love j.  crew for its classic staples, but recently the quality of its clothing has gone downhill, while prices remain the same. it's really unfortunate to see a brand and style so loved throw away its quality and trustworthiness. i recommend being cautious buying anything online and look for quality in stores."
"my go to store. great sales and beautiful clothing. awesome customer service. well made, beautifully tailored clothing. can be a little pricey, but sales are always phenomenal."
"the best sales ever.  shipping is fast.  they update their online stock almost in real time, so you never have to worry about that dreaded ""sorry your item was so popular that we sold out of it"" email (ahem, bloomingdales.com). i visit j. crew again and again for my husband and myself!"
they make extremely nice clothes for business casual and you can just golf. their clothes for together really well i've owned one pair of their shorts for about six years now and used it at least three times a year but it more in other years so a lot a lot of times
"i love j.crew. it has been one of my favorite retailers for years and years now. my only desire is that it would be slightly cheaper, but wouldn't that be great for everything? a girl can dream. their products are high quality and pretty. some stores are better than others in my opinion, but shopping the website is just as great with their amazing sales!"
"j. crew is such a classic store! really good quality of clothing. it is a bit out of my price range, but i always check out their stores, outlets, and online for some good deals. my favorite purchase ever would have to be a burgundy pencil skirt. i've been wearing it for a few years now, and it is still in great condition!"
"if your complaint is the price, then you really need to take into account the quality. jcrew clothing lasts and that is the biggest differentiator. they have classic styles that are timeless as well as more trendy items per season. i typically stalk my email inbox for sales and coupons codes which help a lot. it's worth it!"
"there is always a sale! i think the design went off the rails for a while and has started coming back to what i love jcrew for. i always buy their cashmere and enjoy their shoes and jewelry. if i ever need an outfit for work or a professional purpose, jcrew is my first thought as i know they have wear-to-work staples."
"j. crew has quality clothes albeit at a price.  if you're on a budget, probably not the best place to shop, but they do have great, quality work clothes.  they also carry clothes with a generally preppy style.  i enjoy shopping here and have purchased some great classic pieces for my work wardrobe."
i recently bought a few bathing suits for summer from jcrew online. while they were super cute and from the main sight (not the outlet) the material wrinkles so easily and the suit takes hours to dry after you get out of the pool. i still like jcrew but might hold of on buying a bathing suit from there for a while.
i love the classic feel of this store. i always stick up on my basics and my sweaters. they always have the best sales and selections. they are very friendly with returns and process or very quickly. i always start here with my basics and then find that are they are timeless through each year and home up wonderfully
"i have been a huge j. crew girl since i was in junior high school! i love the classic and simply styles that you can get here, but there are also fun prints and designs to choose from! now that i'm in college and starting to look for big girl jobs i would definitely buy interviewing and business attire from j. crew."
"i love the clothing that j crew offers. they have so many great staple items. they're a little expensive, but i usually can find great sales and double sales on their website. they also have the j crew factory store if you want their clothing for a little less. if i could have an entire closet of j crew, i would."
"if you're a fan of minimalistic, good quality, and also kind of youthful clothes, than jcrew is the store for you! their things are very unique, on trend, but they aren't super flashy. so even if you buy a print from them, it is still neutral enough that it'll be relevant in  a few years :)"
i keep going back to j crew for their staple clothes that go well in a work environment. but having said that they haven't switched up a lot of their products in a while and the quality is definitely declining. i would recommend shopping there but for staples like pants or button downs.
"when i think of j. crew, i think class. which made it the perfect choice to go to for my bridesmaid's gifts. i bought them each a gorgeous statement necklace that was perfect for the big day, or any day really. i'm so glad i was able to give them something so beautiful and timeless."
j crew has a style of clothes that i would exclusively buy if i could afford the the entire store!! the quality is amazing and the styles are always up to date and fitting for all types of occasions! i love the classy looks i find there. the only thing is the prices can be quite high.

j.crew has some great pieces that i love so much! there are definitely some items that are very classic and perfect to have for a long time. my favorite purchase is this eyelet top for the summer. it is super cute and flattering! the sizing does seem to run bigger than usual.
"j. crew has wonderful, high quality clothes that are always on trend. the workers are always so helpful and kind too. i normally go here to get clothes for work. i am petite so really enjoy shopping here because they carry smaller sizes. i love when they are running sales online!"
i actually work at jcrew so i know the time and effort each associates puts into their customers. they are very genuine and love their job. the store is always well organized well placed. probably some of the friendliest sales associates you will ever meet- and that is not me being bias
i don't have a jcrew in my area so i do a majority shopping online for both myself and my boyfriend. they are a little pricey but the quality of the product is worth is. i love the variety for both men and women. their jewelry is great! i would definitely shop here again!
"i have only every had one problem with something i ordered from jcrew. i ordered a skirt and then sent me one that the hem came out after wearing it once. you have to be careful about your laundry with jcrew, but the clothes are so cute and it is my favorite brand."
"j. crew is the best thing to ever happen to me. i love the quality of their clothes and the price isn't too bad either if you know how to shop. the sale section of the regular and factory stores having incredible deals, and they offer student discounts on top of that!"
"i miss getting this catalogue.  i have not bought anything from j.crew since high school 17 years ago, but it was my go to for hs.  i loved the simplicity and quality of the outfits you can buy at j. crew.  i would love to see a few new items and receive a new catalogue to view new products."
"i love shopping on this website. the quality is very good, and there is a good mix of pieces that are classic and on trend. i love the bright colors they include every season, along with the basics. it's a very easy website to navigate, and the shipping is fairly fast."
for all my work attire i end up at jcrew. they are my spot when i am looking for some comfy business wear. the staff is always so helpful and they are always having great promotional deals going on. the staff normally is the first one to update on the latest sales.
"i like j crew for office wear. they have a few sales, which is good for some pieces. their website is pretty convenient for browsing things, and email updates are also super useful for knowing when sales are going on, order pickups are also super easy too."
"while i don't always shop at jcrew, every time that i do i can usually find something that i like. they have great staple items like sweaters and earrings that are always affordable and usually will go on sale eventually. i would recommend shopping there."
i like to sift through the sale section of the website and keep an eye out for good deals. i really love the clothing and style but regular priced items can just be so expensive here. sometimes the quality is worth it for some items and others it's just not.
"this website is so easy to navigate and knows my style weaknesses. i love j.crew clothing and have found a lot of great items on the website for some really good deals, too! when i order from there, the email updates are reliable and not too frequent. love it!"
"i think the jcrew website is a great user experience and has a lot of fantastic, lifestyle oriented content. the clothing is easy to shop and explore new arrivals, however i usually find myself clicking over to the factory site for less expensive goods! :)"
"my favorite t shirts and tank tops for everyday wear.  with a little one to run after all day long, i need a soft and comfy shirt.  the v neck cotton shirts are the perfect shirt! lightweight and so comfortable!  can't wait to buy a couple more colors!"
"i love shopping online at jcrew because you can find such good deals! i love looking at the sale and clearance pages to find some treasures at unbelievable prices for the quality. i couldn't afford to shop at the real store, so i love the website!"
j.crew is a great store/brand.  nordstrom now carried this brand. i have a j crew extra small tall jacket i love. i like that they carry tall for narrow people. i often have trouble finding clothes that is not too wide that is the correct length.
"i became a big fan of the j.crew brand while in college, and the quality of clothing continues to remain high. when they have sales, i make sure to stock up on basics, such as its famous chino shorts that come in a variety of comfortable lengths."
"j. crew! how i wish i could afford you! i love this store with all my heart, but i usually wait until things go on sale to purchase. however, i'm never unhappy with their clothing/products. they are great quality and last a long, long time."
love the store but at times i find that its shoes really hurt my feet. the clothes themselves are super cute but i only go in there when there is a sale since it is a bit pricy but the fabric quality is really good so you really are paying for what you get.
i love j. crew! their plain t's are the most comfortable thing in the world! the fabric is so soft! it is a little pricy but definitely worth it for the quality. my experience shopping there was fine the employees were super helpful and friendly.
"excellent customer service, very rarely have i had an issue with an order but if i ever do they are super accommodating. j.crew has highly quality products without the luxury brand price tag, i shop here all the time, my go to store."
"i really like j crew for work clothes, the marti pant is one of my favorites. i don't normally shop in the store, because it seems like the selection is pretty limited but every time i go into a store, all the employees are very nice."
the website is easy to navigate and always running some type of sale. i like the section where i can just shop the looks. it allows me to see outfits and ideas in one place. and then i don't have to wonder if things fit together.
i love shopping jcrew.com even more than going into the stores!  there is almost always an awesome coupon code to use on the website and you can browse entire collections or types of items without having to look throughout a store.  the sale section is always stocked with great deals on shoes and jewelry!
i love this store my mom and i go there a lot and shop to keep up on the newest trends. i love this store and they always have such cute and affordable clothing. it is highly recommended that you go there and find something for yourself
"jcrew is excellent for shopping for specifics such as a nice dress for an occasion, or a cute vest. they have great quality clothes at pretty expensive prices but they're worth the price tag! i will always be a loyal customer."
most people either shop at banana republic or j.crew amd i'm definitely a j.crew shopper. i have a more slim body type so their clothes are more tailored to my frame. i also like how classic and simple their silhouettes are.
i love j. crew! they always have great sales. i wouldn't say they are completely my style but i can always find some great staple pieces there. i shop there every time there is an outlet mall near and i often check their website!
very comfortable clothes which may be on the most higher end side. my favorite thing about j.crew is that even some of the men's clothes look good since the oversized clothing look is what i like to go for in the winter.
the jcrew website is super easy to use! making it super easy to purchase the latest in fashion. no room for improvement from my point of view. great quality clothes and accessories. i shop here a lot! i love this store!
i've recently bought short there and i think they are excellent and great quality. i was greeted at the door and helped right away. even tho they do have more matronly things sometimes you can find a good steel.
"i love shopping for trendy, classy work clothes at j. crew. their materials are high quality and not too pricey. it's worth the price paid because the products last so long. i'm definitely brand loyal to j. crew."
i love jcrew because i know my fit here. i don't have to try things on and  i love that. i dislike that they've changed the fit on a lot of their work pants. i no longer buy mine here for that reason now.
only buy from j crew outlet stores. very cute fall clothing and comfortable professional clothing options. love a few scarves i purchased last year. the typical stores are on the pricey side. not a frequent shopper at all.
"love shopping at jcrew! their work clothes is very beautiful and classy, they also have bathing suits and great quality every day clothes and shoes. they offer good sales as well. i would definitely continue to shop there!"
i love j crew. i can't say enough good things about this store. the style is classic and will last forever. they have quality pieces that are always in style! i would say about half of my wardrobe is from here!
"i love shopping here! i got so many cute shirts, tank tops and even jeans! it's a little bit pricey and the clothes are good quality so it's worth it! i will definitely recommend this store and i will return!! love it!!"
"classic, modern, chic. j. crew is the best place to shop when looking for professional clothing. my favorite blazer is a beautiful khaki j. crew blazer. worth every penny. i will be a lifelong customer!"
"i recently purchased a few pairs of men's boxers from j. crew for my fiancé. they are his favorite. not only are they of great quality, but they are very soft and comfortable. we will be returning to purchase more!"
the consistency in sizing you get with jcrew is what keeps me coming back. you always get high quality and consistency. i can order the same items in all the colors and know they will be perfect!
ordered the dual tassel lariat necklace from jcrew outlet. this necklace was on clearance plus an additional 30% off plus free shipping! got this for under $10. super cute & trendy!
excellent quality and very fashionable. can be a bit pricey so looks for sale items. if washed and dried according to labels the clothing will last forever and some pieces are timeless.
"this store is nice. it offers a variety of products, but at a hefty price. in comparison to others, the clothes are of the same quality, but you have to pay more. i shop here sometimes and typically find what i need. one bonus is that they offer discounts for educators!"
one of my favorite go to stores. the clothing is timeless and fashionable always! i am never disappointed with the quality of these clothes. they are a little pricey but well worth it!
j crew is a great store a place to come and get staple pieces for your wardrobe that will never go out of style. that classic all american look and a touch of sophistication.
"this place is perfect when i am shopping for work clothes or something with a little more class. seriously, a string of pearls goes perfect with pretty much anything from here!"
if you're good about sifting through you can find some really good deals! i look through probably once a week and purchase once every 6 weeks. good quality stuff that lasts.
professional clothing and nice casual clothing. i still have a jacket from over 10 years ago that still looks like new and fits well! great quality so the price is worth it!
i am so over going into their stores because the staff is always pretty snotty and the store is always a mess. i prefer to shop online for this one and always find what i need pretty quickly.
"pretty expensive.  some of the clothing is worth the pretty penny, but going to the store is worth it because sometimes the items are cheaper.  the factory store can be ok at times too"
"the prices are great for classic pieces. i get a lots of my corporate work clothes here, becuase they are long lasting basics pieces that i can mix and match with"
i love this store for fun and quirky work pieces. the staff is well trained and generally helpful when it comes to suggestions or helping customers order things from the store to be shipped home or offering alternatives.
jcrew offers high quality products at a reasonable price. they are on the expensive side but you get what you're paying for and their clothing lasts a good long time!
"i buy all my jeans at jcrew, they have the best fit and i love all the washes they come in, wish they came a little longer because they always hit my ankles but still love them"
love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it!

i love j.crew they've got great close their durable they last forever and the prices are really good. they always have really good sales and great coupons out
"i would say that j crew has nice clothes, but i feel as though j crew factory is much more affordable. the regular j crew store is either hit or miss for me."
"what can i say, classic classic classic. i recently bought a straw beach hat with an oversized brim with ""beach time on it. perfect for pool days and vacay."
"once you know your style in store, it’s always to use the online. i typically use their factory store because it’s the same product but much more affordable."

love their style and selection. prices are sometimes a bit high for the quality in comparison to some other retailers at this price point.
over time i️ have slowly started to not love j. crew as much. i️ feel their quality has dwindled a bit and has not really gotten better.
i think the quality is there but if possible i would def go into the store or a factory store bc they'll usually honor a student discount

"great clothing, offers a discount for students j crew is the best for the fall also...."
another go to favorite place to shop. very reasonably priced on certain things as well.
my favorite site for online browsing. the items are always high quality and so stylish!
love!! great place to find quality clothes for any occasion for any one in the family!
they have great quality clothing and if you shop right they can be fairly inexpensive.
love the quality of j crew! everything is timeless! the shipping was prompt and fast!
great sales and clearance.  the new balance for j. crew line is my absolute favorite.
great company with a conscious and sustainable business model. you find grear sales and their service is good.
"love jcrew since i can remember. the quality is not at all what it used to be, but the customer service is excellent if you have a credit card from them! otherwise it depends on manager of store! overall still good company"
"jcrew is one of my favourite places to browse online and indulge (lol impulse shopping). fortunately, they have a high turnaround on their website and almost always have great pieces marked down substantially in their sale section. i have been wearing their merino wool trousers for years and they haven't given up on me yet. actually everything i own from them in awesome quality. my boyfriend shops here too and we both love it."
"jcrew carries some really cute stuff, but honestly i don't think that their clothes are worth the markup.  the quality seems to be about the same as some of the stuff that i have seen in cheaper fast fashion stores.  i think jcrew is having a bit of an identity crisis and needs to decide whether it wants to truly be high-end (providing better quality), or budget friendly."
great basics but the selection is usually safe and very conservative- definitely great for anyone who works in an office.  the quality is always amazing and dependable- they have the perfect t-shirts and always have the entire store on sale! so i suggest avoiding buying at full price and heading to the outlets!
j crew was one of the few places i was able to find business attire when i was first recovering and wearing a 000 in adult size-runs of clothing. it was nice to be able to dress my age rather than making kids clothes work for me.
i like jcrew accessories they are high quality. they are expensive but they look expensive too. i always buy at the end of the season when they have sales. you can catch good products for a good price. if you see an outlet store that is a must stop especially after christmas when they have the good sales.
"i used to go to j.crew as it was more of a formal store and if had clothes i could use for job interviews, family outings, etc.. but it has slowly dwindled to something much more casual and lost the original formal charm that was the reason i purchased from them to begin with."
"j crew is one of my favourite stores to shop at. unfortunately, it's pretty expensive, so i don't always buy everything i like. however, their sales are pretty awesome, so i often end up getting great pieces at very reasonable prices!"
i really like jcrew online a log because firstly some of the deals are better than the in store ones and secondly you can find certain items that are not sold in stores. the only downside is the shipping rate to canada.
"j. crew has such cute clothes!! i love their style and variety. i wish they were more affordable because then i'd shop there way more often. but it's still great to check out every once in a while, you never know what's on sale!"
my boyfriend loves shopping here. classic and stylish clothing for anyone in your life. they also have an amazing children's section. the quality is good unless you get it from the outlets... good prices bad quality.
"a fun brand! not so cheap, so i usually shop there on sales at the end season sales with free shipping specials. it's good quality and trendy."
"amazing quality but i often only shop sale stuff from j.crew. i love their accessories. i also find their clothing last years. my go to cardigan is from j.crew, looks great onto of everything."
i love their dresses and cardigans. they often have sales on nordstrom and it is very affordable. i just bought a sweetheart coral dress and have received many compliments on it!
"i really like j. crew they have very pretty things. the best time to buy is on sales, they do a lot of them and you can find almost everything on sale at some point."
i got a few items from jcrew website. i normally get their sale items since i feel the normal price item are too high. the quality of the clothes are consistently good and i like that most of their clothes are cotton. the only minus is the price.
i spent a long time looking for a specific tshirt and found it on jcrew.com. it shipped fast and fit perfectly. the website was easy to navigate and i wouldn't improve on anything. i would definitely recommend the website to everyone.
i use jarred.com quite often. the shipping is reasonable and very fast. the clothing is all very high quality and most is timeless and not too trendy. great for high quality basics that you can keep for years.
classy and sasssy brand always find outfits for work and the prices are great. my fav pants are from j. crew i absolutely love their sales and their products.
i love the jcrew style. i shop often at the outlet because of the great prices. their window merchandising is so well done. and the preppy style is to die for!
"amazing costumer service! i love this store and the fact that they have a jcrew factory it is so good for my holiday shopping, they always have a sale going on"
easy to use website. navigating the pages it's super simple. everything you need to know is on the main page. great tabs to find what you are looking for.
love when they have sales. prices and shipping rates all great. fit usually very predictable. can order usual
"love jcrew! their styles are awesome and unique and a wide variety of sizes, especially sizes for petite builds which are often hard to find"
somethings at this store are crazy expensive. while they have really nice trending styles and colours i find that they are quite expensive.
"i love jcrew, always plenty of choice only thing i'd say is the price point is pretty high but the stock is to die for so.. i always buy 🙈"
have never purchased from this place i haven't heard really anything about them but like i say i will give a place a try of course
great fashion style !!! great prices in general . i love the store and i buy from it most of the time . good quality as well
me encanta toda la marca en si wowww todo lo que venden es de buena calidad y el precio vale la pena porque son piezas duraderas
love this store as it has the cutest stuff in it! it’s pretty expensive so i don’t like to buy too much but i love everything!
a little pricey but you know what you buy is going to last! the material is great and i find that the sizing is true to fit!
i love buying my husband weekend wear at j crew. i just wish that men's clothes went on sale as much as women's do!
