"is it any surprise that i love madewell if i love j.crew? they are sister brands afterall. madewell is just as classic and chic with a bit of boho to it. madewell is expensive but the quality supports the price tag. one of my favorite items from madewell is their tote bag that can be seen on ever fashion blogger's arms. i purchased mine back in 2006 and still carry it pretty often. the leather has held up nicely with a little character that it's been well loved. the same with my little booties, same year and i still wear them. you won't regret your big purchases, it'll last you forever!"
"i shop basically shirts/tops at madewell and really like their style. however, i think their products are too overpriced. $70-$90 for a top is a lot. jeans are good quality and they have amazing program where you donate one pair of jeans, you get $20 off jeans from madewell. i would recommend to shop for tops/dress here. but they should consider lower the price on some items"
"madewell is j. crew’s cooler older sister. it’s rustic meets boho chic. the style of the store and clothes is much of the allure when entering until you see the price tags. madewell offers terrific basics but they all seem to be overpriced. i always bee-line to the sales rack shamelessly. even though the sale is of a season passed, they are timeless pieces so you never feel behind, so if you see something you like at full-price, there is a fair chance you’ll see it 3 month’s later 30% off. another thing is madewell has student discounts for college students which is another great advantage."
i heard a lot about madewell and recently made the trip in store.  i was really impressed at their
madewell is in my top 3 favorite stores ever. i spend way too much money in this store and have zero shame! their clothes are timeless pieces of which never get old. their jeans are specifically some of my favorite items from there! the wide leg crop jeans are my absolute favorite item i’ve ever bought! perfect for the summertime because they breathe and keep you cool! no fuss over being sweaty and going to the bathroom!
"i mainly shop at madewell for their bags. i have the transport tote and small leather pouch from them and i love them so much! the material is top quality and durable. i’ve had my transport tote for about 3 years or so and it’s holding up great, and i put a lot of heavy things in that tote. while madewell is expensive, i can at least vouch for their bags and say that it’s completely worth it."
"everything about madewell is amazing. i love how the store pursues creativity and showcases others creativity. they have incredible quality clothes, shoes, leather purses etc. their jeans have to be by far my favorite. some of the highest quality jeans i have ever owned. i love their sleek, minimal, tomboy yet feminine style. although they are more pricey, they are worth it."
they are like a cooler j crew. owned by the same company but this store feels so much more relaxed but also has the same high quality products. they are known for their denim which has so many options! also they do free hemming so that’s great for short girls.
"one of my favorite stores.  the tshirts are completely affordable.  the fit of the jeans are incredible, and they don’t stretch out and lose shape even after years of wear.  the quality of everything is top notch.  it’s a younger, more relaxed version of j. crew, but same quality of clothing!  if you are a fan of clean cut and simple, this is the store for you!"
i recently purchaed a ugh waisted denim from here. i absolutely love madewell jeans! they are so super comfortable and soft. they fit so well! i’m pretty short and at 5’1 i have trouble finding high waisted jeans that fit correctly (i.e. the placement of the back pockets) and these fit like a glove. madewell are forever my go-to denim brand !
i like the general style of madewell. although it’s hard finding stuff right now for my body type since everything seems to be high waisted and cropped tops. my leather bags are madewell and great quality. i always look at madewell for style inspiration and have gotten a couple well loved pieces there. i love that they give you a birthday gift!
"i love the style of madewell clothes, they have great basics and also fun stuff! the only thing i would say is that there is comparable stuff/brands that are cheaper. don’t get me wrong the quality is great! i just find that sometimes they are overpriced. i love their accessories though, the sunglasses and jewelry are great and so fun."
"madewell is one of my favorite clothing brands. most of my jeans are from madewell and for the most part, i think they are made very well. i love their clothing and their styles but two pairs of jeans have broken on me so far. i will be a loyal customer as i have been for years but i might not be buying any more black jeans from them."
this is my most favorite company / brand in the whole entire world. the vibes from the company just bring me pure happiness and joy and they have the most amazing jeans ever that fit me better than a glove. i will forever love madewell. all of my jeans are from here and it will be hard for me to ever change that. 20/10 recommend!!!
"i really like madewell clothing. everything is very classy and cute while still feeling young and hip. as the brand states, the clothes are all made really well and last over the years. my only complaint is that the brand can get a bit pricey on certain items. really love their pants for someone a little bit curvy like me."
"love madewell jeans! they are so comfortable and a sturdy quality. i wish they made more 100% cotton but otherwise i always find a good fit. i’ve never done it myself, but i know that you can donate your old jeans there too to receive a credit toward a new purchase. a great brand that’s environmentally conscious!"
"madewell is my favorite store ever! the timeless style and neutral color scheme gets me every time. sometimes some of the items are a little out of my price range, but they offer a 15% off teacher discount which is great! they also have sales and discounts occasionally so it makes it easier to splurge!"
"i love madewell from the jewelry to the jeans to the tops to the skirts everything is super cute. i love going to the store because of how trendy and fashionable everything is. my only complaint is that some of the clothes are quite ""boxy"" and for my figure it doesn't look very good sometimes."
"i like the transport tote from madewell so much, that i bought three! i have one in brown, black and navy, so i can cover all my neutral color needs. the quality is great, the leather holds up and the style is timeless. i love the way i can carry everything in one place and it's very versatile"
i really like madewell. they have good quality clothing that is actually made well. their jeans are awesome and they even offer free tailoring to make sure your jeans fit great. the only downside for me is that i am lucky to fit into their largest size. i wish they would expand their size range :(
"i love this plae so much!!! i just love the style of this store so much! i honestly wishes i have everything from this place! all the madewell stores that i have been to are very clean and organized. also they always decorated the place and make it very cozy and cute, i love that!! since i am still a student, i wish the price of everything from this store can a lower. but i do think the quality of everything from this store is amazingly good!  love this store so much!!"
madewell is my go-to for timeless pieces that i know are made to last. the best jeans i’ve ever purchased - available in so many beautiful colors and various inseams. the staff has always been stellar at every location i’ve shopped in - their customer service is unparalleled in person and online!
great quality and really cute stuff. best jeans ever that will last a long time. great service everytime i go in there to shop. they’re clothes change a lot so you can always find something new
love their leather goods! great quality but price is pretty steep. i appreciate their broad sizing ranges as i wear 00/0 petite and it's hard to find clothes that fit right. their clothing quality is stellar and style is between boho and business casual. prices are high if not on sale though.
"it’s more pricey for my liking, so i don’t get to shop here often, but i love the style! this is my “splurge” store. tops and accessories are my favorite things to buy from madewell. my leather purse and wallet are necessities. definitely love the style and wish i could buy the entire store!"
"the quality of madewell clothing is really all in its name, it’s made well. i love the clothes, they’re a little simplistic but also different and interesting. they are however very pricey. the quality never fails but it is a pick and choose situation when shopping there due to the price."
"madewell produces wonderful quality items. the jewelry stays untarnished and the clothes fit like a dream. the only negative is the pricing and the typical straighter cut fit. i am curvy and don’t always feel catered to. they are definitely splurge items for me, but worth it when i do."
"my closet primarily consists of madewell. i love all their shirts, jeans, jackets and shoes. i would recommend going to a store, if possible to try on jeans for sizing - but they do offer free shipping/returns on denim. their shoes are pretty stylish and surprisingly comfortable."
madewell is my go to brand. there jeans are miracle workers. i’ve never had a pair of jeans fit so well and stay fresh for many many wears. my style is very minimal and simple and i always can count on madewell for some new pieces to add to my closet. the trick is to shop sale ;)
all i can say it that sales are worth it. if you sign up for a membership and keep your eye on the sale section you can get some really good deals. i got two of the famous wrap tops for under $20 each and a pair of $100 jeans for $29. if you see graphic t-shirt or plain t-shirt get it. if the size is too big get it anyway because these shirts are beyond comfortable and super versatile.
"madewell is one of my favorite stores! i love they’re style and how it’s the perfect blend between casual and formal. although i would not call madewell affordable, i must say that their clothing is perfect for long term usage. buying jeans from madewell is a great investment!"
i love madewell but the price is not worth some of their items. you can get the same quality at other department stores such as zara without having to spend as much. madewell definitely makes amazing shoes that are worth the price.... i have gray boots from there i still wear.
"madewell is my favorite stores at the moment.  the quality of their items is always great. especially their jeans! for a curvy girl like me it’s difficult to find a pair of great fitting jeans that make the junk in the trunk feel great.  i dread trying jeans on but at madewell it’s a completely different story, i want to try all their jeans on! the staff always seems to be very cheerful.  they always make me feel super comfortable when i’m there.  they’re also very knowledgeable and helpful! i can go on, and on about this company :) all in all, madewell is great! (the name says it all)"
"the quality of madewell can’t be beat. it is the perfect marriage between modern and retro. they have created their own classic. i will never buy a pair of jeans from anywhere else because the fit and durability is amazing. i had to throw away a pair that i bought in high school (8-9 years ago) because they started to tear. that’s nine years of consistent wear and wash and dry, repeat. when i went to replace them at madewell they had a similar, if not, the same style, which made it easy to grab and go. so easy, that i bought them in two washes."
"really digging this brand. fresh, on trend, very la style. sizing is a little wonky - that’s probably my biggest issue is just consistency of sizing since i’m buying it all online. shirts have been pretty consistent but shorts and pants have been pretty all over the place."
"favorite place to shop, hands down. definitely on the more expensive side, but i've never had jeans that fit me so well or lasted me so long. their sale section is often good, so be sure to check it out. madewell bags are also unprecedented - great for people on the go!"
"i love madewell's aesthetic, but i've found many of their goods to be ridiculously overpriced for their quality (especially their clothing made from synthetic fabrics.) i recently ordered the small drawstring crossbody bag and i couldn't believe how cheap and dry the leather felt. their sizing also seems inconsistent-- i've had to return the past few items i've ordered because they don't fit, despite following the measurement guide."
i love this store so much. i purchase something new from here on a monthly basis. the quality is great and so are the styles. it’s one of my favorite stores. this skirt came from there and it’s a new favorite.
"so i have to be honest: i don’t shop a lot at madewell because it’s a little beyond my price point. however, i just bought my first pair of denim overalls from there. i was scared. i am a short, curvy woman, with a giant caboose - can i even wear overalls? the answer was yes. if you are willing to shell out some"
the madewell store near me has some of the best customer service ever! everyone there is so helpful with finding jeans and shoes and anything else i could need. i also love that i can get a really good discount on jeans when i bring in an old pair to recycle.
"my very favorite store. this is where i go to get long lasting, beautiful basics and bags. i have carried my medium transport tote everyday for two years. the fabrics are great quality, the designs are classic but never boring, and the jeans fit like a dream."
"the store is okay, they do have some cute items of clothing and some cute accessories, however i think some of the stuff is unnecessarily overpriced."
best jeans i’ve ever owned! they fit me perfectly and have the effortless classic look! i only have one pair but they are easily my favorite very authentic and everything you could ask for in a jean! definitely will be on the look out for more stuff from them!
"madewell is my go to store for basics and comfy yet cute clothing. the prices are reasonable and typically you can find items on sale. their sweaters are thick and fit well. their jeans are definitely worth buying. the fit, material and style are on point."
about 70% of my wardrobe is madewell. i just love how sophisticated yet young it is. their jeans will last a life time and their basic tees are the perfect wardrobe staple. i literally have them in every color. i also love their fun dresses and blouses!
"loooove madewell. love their instagram account. their 10” high riser jeans are a gift from god himself. i love that they have a wide variety of styles and sizes. shoes are 10/10, leather goods (bags specifically) 10/10. expensive, but amazing quality."
madewell’s name really says it all! their products are wonderful quality and fit. i am super tall so their jeans are some of my favorite pairs! i also love all of their accessories. i recently got a jean hat from them and it’s my go to hat for style!
"madewell is my all time favorite place to shop! no matter if i’m looking for casual wear, flirty date outfits, or work wear, i always find something i absolutely love. the products are at a higher end price point, but the quality is beyond worth it."
"very nice fabric. always on style! from casual to party look and classy events, this bramd has it! from affordable price to high end delights they have lots of clothes and products to choose from! visit the boutique for more selections and try ons"
madewell is such a classic chic store that has amazing products for anyone. the denim is one of my favorite parts of the store i've had the same pair of jeans since seventh grade and they still fit in there wash is incredible it's still the same.
"if i could give madewell 100 stars out of 10, i completely would! i am a size 4 and could never find jeans that were small in the waist but had room in thigh/butt area until lo and behold i discovered madewell. i feel like they designed jeans specifically for me. i own a few pairs and they are all as comfortable as yoga pants. the roadtrippers are amazing! this brand has completely changed my outlook toward jeans, which i once regarded as uncomfortable and unflattering."
"they have beautiful clothes that are a bit overpriced for the quality. i had an amazing pair of jeans from here that were great for petite sizing, but they tore like crazy after a couple washes. disappointing and haven’t bought jeans again."
"madewell is where my favorite jeans are from. yes, the jeans are a little more expensive but they hold there shape well and will seriously last for years! and, if you donate an old pair of jeans, you get $20 off a new pair of madewell jeans!"
i always get compliments on the dress i purchased at madewell! can’t argue with a little black dress staple. (every wardrobe should have one!) i took it with me when i went to italy and the fabric withstood the heavy duty laundry washers there so that alone speaks to the quality of the piece!
they have super cute basics that you are able to dress up or dress down! there products are pretty affordable and i’m absolutely obssesed with there jumpsuits and tees! i also have a great time finding jeans as they make extra long lengths
i love the quality of clothing here. my favorite casual shirts and beanies are from here. it’s more expensive but the quality makes it worth the price. i definitely recommend shopping here. the jewelry and accessories are always nice too.
as a denim lover madewell is like my dream come true inside a retail store. i’ve bought a lot of jeans over the years and i’m telling you my madewell jeans are hands down my favorite ones! i love the simplicity of what they have to offer.
this is my go to place to shop! favorite brand ever! i also send clients there that essentially want a version of my exact style. their jeans fit like no other and i love the effortless style from pieces i buy there. great quality always!
"i love this store!! the clothes they sell are amazing and always on trend! they always have what i’m looking for. there clothes can be a bit more pricier compared to some stores, but the clothes are well made and last you a long time :)"
"i love madewell. some of their items can be a bit pricey in my opinion, but they are very cute and trendy, and fit so well! i have quite a few pieces by madewell, and they are well made and will last multiple seasons. highly recommend!"
"i love madewell's look. i pretty much want everything in the store at any given time. and some things i've purchased have lasted for a really long time -- the post wallet in particular is still just as beautiful as when i first got it. but i don't see why they need to charge as much as they do for t-shirts, for example. they are a nice cut, but they don't last any longer than any other t shirt. i think their prices could be far more reasonable than they are."
"madewell definitely lives up to its name. the employees are always very knowledgeable and helped me when trying to find jeans. their clothes are not only so fashionable, but they are so well made that i know they will last a long time"
"i love madewell! they have the cutest products and high end quality. the shopping experience is always amazing and adorable. madewell can at times be on the more expensive side, but the products they carry are worth it in my opinion."
"a little overpriced, but if you are a madewell insider, you receive a lot of deals and coupons via email, which makes it a little more worth it. free alterations make me feel like they are a brand that truly cares about the customer."
"i love this store!!!!!! it has the exact aesthetic i’m looking for. weather i’m feeling masculine and feminine that day! the quality is great, the price fits the quality, and the durability is what you would expect! love love love!"
"it seems to me that the quality is considerably better than that of it's sister brand, j. crew. the jeans they sell here are particularly good, as are their leather accessories and shoes. i regularly shop here. i highly recommend this brand."
"i bought a black tee with a leather like trim around the coller  and it's just the best! it fits perfectly, with the bottom still loose just the way i like it. the sleeves are the perfect length. it goes with anything."
"obsessed since the first time i walked into the place! wonderful atmosphere and amazing clothes and accessories!! their designs are fabulous, their fit is great, and the quality is superb! if you haven’t gone in yet, you should!"
"i just discovered this store and i love it. very simple, classic clothing. they have everything that you need for the perfect weekend outfit. a lot of the clothing is expensive but the quality is excellent and worth the price."
"the quality of their clothing is always great! while some items can be a bit pricey, you can always be sure that you will be getting the best possible quality with each product! i almost always make a madewell stop at the mall!"
"i love the items i have purchased from madewell & they tend to have really good sales.  of all the items i have purchased, i have only had one issue with quality, so i would say 90% of their items are high quality and hold up well."
"i buy a lot of my neutrals and tees from madewell. their stuff fits so well and never messes up in the wash. their white tees are perfect for working in food and bev., and their hair scarfs add a cute pop to any neutral outfit."
"i will forever wear madewell jeans after buying my first pair this past september. i think that they flatter my body better than any other pair of jeans i've worn and i adore the high waist. i want every pair they have available but have not broken down and tried any jeans besides the 9 and 10 inch skinny jeans. my dog's nails created little tears in the jeans, which i don't love and i know would happen with any kind of denim."
madewell makes such great jeans i have a few pair and as a college student the student discount is great along with the jean trade in program they do! they have such a simple style and it’s one of my favorite places to shop!
i’ve actually never purchased anything from madewell because it is always too expensive. i do love all of their stuff though and their accessories are very cute! one day when i have more income i would definitely shop here!
i really love this brand and have been shopping here a lot recently. the fabrics and materials they use are so high quality. recently got a pair of their bronze cuff bracelets—super affordable and cute! highly recommend 👌🏻
i have several clothes and leather bags from madewell! the jeans are amazing. they are the only jeans that fit me well. also the leather bags are so durable. i have had mine for 3 years and there are no scratches or pulls.
madewell jeans are my absolute favorite!! i will never buy another brand of jeans. i have a pair that are 6 years old and they have never lost shape or elasticity. the color hasn’t faded at all which is extremely shocking
"best quality wardrobe staples! their madewell insider program is so good, 100% free to join and be a part of and you get free shipping and embroidery/monogramming! such high quality items, i love their shoes especially."
a great brand with very good quality pieces. the denim is of a very high quality and the cuts are very flattering. the non-denim products are of equally high quality and have never left me disappointed after a purchase
prices are high for simple looks but they’re so cute that it’s worth it! madewell has a very girl next door look but heightened to be professional and cute! always love shopping online for this store since there isn’t one local to me
the best jeans at this price point! the washes are so flattering and i get compliments with every wear. i love how the control pockets on their skinny jeans really suck everything in. talk about a confidence boost!
i love madewell! i have been into a shop in south carolina and the experience was amazing. they products are pretty affordable especially when you catch a sale. i will definitely spend my money here again sometime.
"i love all of their clothes there especially their jeans. everything there is super cute and super comfortable, so you don’t have to give up comfort for style. i would definitely recommend to anybody and everybody!"
"madewell is consistently one of my top brick and mortar shopping destinations. from well-curated and clean displays to cute events in-store, i always find myself wandering in when strolling on a weekend afternoon."
"madewell is a new brand for me. i love their easy california style and neutral color pattern. their jeans and jewelry are my favorite pieces they carry. sizing is tts, and i would recommend this brand to anyone."
"i love, love, love madewell. the prices are great. the staff is great. could be cheaper sometimes. the shopping experience is fun. a lot of locations, too. i like that because it’s convenient. i do recommend it."
really cute clothing but overpriced a lot for the quality of the piece. still love them though and will always check to see what their new line is. love their new shoes! i’ll def keep going back to them for sure.
"i only gave it four stars because madewell is very pricey. however, when they have sells their deals are sooo good! i once bought two dresses for 12 dollars each. i also really love their head scarfs and jewelry."
"one of the best lines out there! from there simple leather bags, belts, jewelry and clothing, i want one of everything in my size there. i always leave with something amazing! their quality everyone would love!"
"madewell used to be one of my go-to store for casual separates. their sale section remains worth a look, but i’ve noticed a steep decline in the quality of their clothes. i’ve also noticed them producing clothes solely intended for the sale section, made of cheaper material, that they then label with fake msrps to make you think you’re getting a deal. also, their denim sizing is all over the place."
"madewell jeans are my absolute favorite jeans. i’m petite, so finding jeans that flatter me and aren’t too long can be tricky. i love that they will hem your jeans for you. i find that to be a very nice touch."
love my new madewell jeans! we don’t have a store in my area so i can only shop there when i travel or online. comfy jeans and very stylish! i can’t wait to get more styles and colors! open a store in tampa!!!
"oh madewell, you have my heart. they have the uncanny ability to make a basic tee a luxury item. the quality is a given with this company. their aesthetic is the most pleasing and honestly i want to spend my entire paycheck on their clothes (okay cuz its kinda of expensive... but still) it is becoming sweater weather and i am drooling over their cable knits online. maybe one day.... 10/10"
"madewell is great. i have a ton of their leather products (bags, wallets) and use them everyday. clothes are a bit pricy as well but amazing quality. will continue to shop here. they have good sale as well"
madewell is everything i have ever wanted in a store. the clothing is beautiful. the accessories are clutch. and the shoes and bags are everything.  i wish i could fit in to the denim but now i have goals.
madewell totes are amazing! i’ve had my transport leather tote for about three years now and its in similar condition as when i first purchased it. they are worth the investment because they last forever.
this brand is amazing!! so simple and classic clothing!! i love their style and the quality is outstanding!!! i will definitely continue to but from this brand many times!! the clothes fit my body perfect
love this store. always have the cutest clothes and shoes and handbags. extremely good quality. the people are nice. it can be a little pricy but for the quality of the products it’s so worth the money!!
"madewell is my go to clothing brand. i find their clothing to generally be of good quality and they have clothes that aren’t so trendy they’re dated in a season. i’ve also bought lots of shoes from them and i’ve been very happy with the quality of their footwear, particularly boots. they have great sale on sale promotions every so often and they also always offer free shipping."
"love this place! on the pricier side, but the denim is amazing quality compared to many other retailers. definitely recommend for nicer, more durable pieces that you want to wear for the years to come."
"i've only shopped at madewell once or twice because their pricing is so expensive (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), however, every item i have ever brought from madewell are by far some of my ultimate, most favorite items in my wardrobe. the quality is so up there, i really do like them, i just wish they were  a tad less expensive - but you get what you pay for after all!"
"madewell jeans are my absolute ride or die. they are a great fit if you are on the slightly curvier side, and don’t dip down in the back if you have a large backside. the only downside is the pricing."
my boyfriend has backpacks from this brand and he absolutely loves them. he asks for a new one for christmas each year. they are very fashionable backpacks and come in many different styles. i would recommend buying backpacks from this brand.
one of my favorite brands.  i love the simplicity of this brand. high quality and love when tops have a little ruffle on them.  fits true to size and last a long time.  i’m a loyal customer to madewell
madewell is one of my favorite stores. i love the quality. the denim fits like a glove. true to size maybe a tiny bit on the stretchy side but washes up great. shirts are great but often run large.
one of my friends introduced me to madewell. ever since then i have been hooked. it is more expensive but you get what you pay for. the clothes are very high quality and always make you stand out.
"madewell used to be one of my favorite stores but i’ve noticed the quality of clothing has gone down. i do love the style and the clothing they sell, it isn’t always the best quality for the price."
"i love love love this store! their whole collection every season is my closet inspo! they’re on the pricier end but you’re really paying for quality! their jeans are super comfy and fits so well, and shows off your great assets ;)"
"i love love love this store! their whole collection every season is my closet inspo! they’re on the pricier end but you’re really paying for quality! their jeans are super comfy and fits so well, and shows off your great assets ;)"
"i wish i discovered this store sooner. i can say that this is one of my favorite stores, and they live up to they’re name. i’ve had some of their jeans for years without problems. i love the aesthetic of they’re clothing and accessories. some people might say that they’re overpriced but i think they’re worth every penny. i wish they’re was a location closer to me"
my go to flannel is the boyfriend flannel from madewell. it is a loose fit so it looks super cute with skinny jeans and boots. they also have the most adorable denim dress right now that i have been eyeing. it is a little pricey but honestly the quality is worth it. i have had madewell clothes for years and they still look brand new. well worth the investment.
"i really love shopping at madewell! you can find some unique pieces that are very well made and will last you a long time, without going out of style in a season or two. they make some of my favorite jeans and basic tees! some of the items can be a little pricey so i always wait for promo codes or sales, plus they have a student discount which is a great plus!"
made well is by far one of the favorite places the shop. the quality of their clothes is great. and i love the simplistic style they offer for the every day woman. i would recommend everyone to shop here!
"great unique made well items and feels locally crafted or something, simple designs with a minimalist vibe but great quality products. a good range of items. i love the bags and sweaters most."
"i keep thinking i'm going to stop shopping at madewell because i'm going to get too old to shop there (i'm 34), but it's not like forever 21 where all the clothes start to look bad on you once you hit a certain age, and that's because the clothes are made well! the materials are thick and flow across the body just right that i keep going back every season."
"just bought my first pair of jeans from madewell when they had a special event for recycling an old pair (bring in a pair from any brand to recycle and you get $20 off).  first of all, this was such a cool idea and awesome that they're taking the time and resources to do it.  also, i love the jeans i bought and will be buying from them again."
"madewell jeans are everything. the styles and cute are incredibly flattering and even more comfortable. i used to hate wearing jeans all day, but i can wear my madewell jeans for hours and hours. every wash is so nice and the jeans are such great quality, i would pay double than what they charge. i get complimented every time i wear my madewell jeans!!"
"although it’s on the pricier side, i do like that they recycle jeans. i’ve never experienced bad customer service here. the sizes are true to your average size and the material of the clothing is always great!"
"although it’s on the pricier side, i do like that they recycle jeans. i’ve never experienced bad customer service here. the sizes are true to your average size and the material of the clothing is always great!"
"the fact that they have a denim bar alone is amazing. i am a true believer now and have taken all of my old jeans in (you get $20 off of your next denim purchase), and am so amazed by the fit of these jeans. they make everything look great, and they are so comfortable. the best quality jeans i have worn (and i have tried tons of designer jeans)!"
i love their quality products! sometimes things are going to be a bit pricier as compared to other stores but their products last a long time and you can feel the quality in the fabric !
love this brand. they have a lot of nice pieces to choose from. i think they’re very relevant and likable. their clothes are well made and designed beautifully. wish they had more sales.
lovely clothing and accessories. however as a student all their items are pretty pricey. my mom bought me their leather tote as a high school graduation gift. nice but can feel heavy.
"i absolutely love most of madewells designs. however, every so often i walk through the entire store and don’t see a single thing that interests me, where most other times i have quite the opposite experience! the stores can sometimes be uncomfortably crowded, and some things are ridiculously overpriced. overall, i love this store."
i love madewell because the clothes are literally made well but at the same time prices are pretty expensive and not always worth it. comparable to free people or urban outfitters.
"my all time favorite store! madewell is amazing in every aspect. amazing employees, quality, and who they are. they used recycled products which makes me want to buy from them more and their clothes are so cute! i don’t even mind spending a lot of money at madewell because i know i’m going to love everything i purchase."
"madewell is by far one of my favorite stores. their basic tee is my favorite and i have every color because you can dress them up or down and the quality is great for the price. every time i walk in the store, i find something that i have to have. everyone knows to buy me madewell for christmas or birthday gifts."
"freaking in love with this store. always feels like a boutique when i walk and the shopping experience is always pleasant. their jewelry/accessories are always everything to me and i usually also purchase fall/winter clothes here! madwell is definitely underrated, and is one of my all time favorite stores!"

"their jeans are incredible! not the normal, good fit but an even more amazing fit then you could expect. my only complaint is the price. not because they are worth less but because my budget does not love how expensive they are. ether way- i still will continue to purchase because the quality is totally worth it."
rather pricey store but you get what you pay for. the items have a lot of quality and are all great casual clothes that will last for a long time. i love shopping online vs store. the store just doesnt have everything to me. they could updated their social media and store appearance. mixed signals of trendy vs grandma
"i love madewell more than any other store in the world. their jeans fit me perfectly. and i love their aesthetic. it is a mix of cool, comfortable and classic.  their leather goods are beautiful and smell amazing. (you know what i mean.) i always check in there 1st for a dress before i go anywhere else."
i dont own much from madewell but i do always love their clothing. i don’t shop there as much because i can’t justify some of the price points. my favorite pair of jeans are the 10” high-rise super skinny jeans. they’re amazing and make me feel great! the quality is awesome!! just wish they weren’t so expensive.
"my favorite jeans and sweaters to date, i cannot wait to get a white pair for summer. so soft, so comfortable."
"madewells clothes are to die for, they are amazing quality and are always very unique, and casual. it is more of a casual/boyfriend fit hipster store. it is not very girly"
they have trendy clothes that fit well. usually do a free shipping promo or clearance promo. chic and trendy!! such a good go to retailer where you can find unique pieces.
"i love madewell's products! i just bought a grey sweater from them and it's my new favorite clothing piece!! the only thing i hate about madewell is that they're pricey, so i don't shop there a lot. but you definitely do get what you paid for, the quality of their products is amazing, i'm such a fan!"
love this brand! they are the best in quality and style. i love their promotional ads because they’re not overly dressy but styled in everyday wear. i have so many pieces from them that are lasting and worth the little extra on the price tag. plus they always have unique colors that i’m in love with!
t-shirts from this place are great. they allow me to feel comfortable in my mom bod but still give me confidence that i am hip and in style! it is too high for my budget but occasionally i will splurge or run into a great deal.
"besides the sizing, i love everything about madewell. they have a vintage feel that"
great brand. i love their sweaters in the winter time. the stores are always clean and staff is friendly. they always have new items and they have great accessories too!
"madewell has quickly become my go to store in the past 2 years. their items are affordable and amazing quality. purses, clothing, shoes, jewelry, all are amazing. i love their t-shirts and short sleeve buttons up. all of their items are such great staples and classics that are easy to dress up."
"i recently purchased the medium transport tote and i am in love with it! it’s the perfect size for petite girls like me. i always feel like larger bags may drown me and make me look even more petite! the medium transport is my favorite bag at the moment, so simple and perfect for everyday use."
i’m knocking a star off because i think madewell is too expensive. but i have to say the quality of their clothing is amazing. i had a pair of jeans here for 6 years until i lost them :( and they were in amazing shape still and fit like a glove without any alterations. they have amazing quality
"i love madewell as my go to for overalls and all things overalls, jeans, and end of the season sales. the items i picked up from madewell have seamlessly in my wardrobe and are classic and timeless. and if their clothes are not the best fit in your body they also have amazing accessories too."
"madewell is such a cute shop, all of their clothing pieces are adorable and their jeans are great quality! i'm looking forward to purchasing a bag from them very soon!"
i loooove madewell so much. it is so cute and so stylish always. however it is expensive however the clothes are very good quality and will last long. love this store
although expansive madewell has amazing stuff and i always want to shop here their stores are clean and easy to shop in and you can get a student discount in stores!

"i love madewell! i’m hooked on their jeans lately and have come to terms that good jeans are worth the investment! the rest of their clothing line is so cute. although, a lot of the shirts and dresses seem to make me look boxy. i’ll definitely keep coming back for the denim though!"
"their jeans are literally made for you. they fit like a glove, a comfortable one. they have great selections of style -flare, high-wasited, low waist, etc. i wish i can shop here more often but it is bit on the pricier side. buying jeans here is kind of like an investment."
"the clothes cost more than i’m used to paying but they are such good quality that you can keep them for a very long tim! i am very impressed with their denim, they fit so nicely and don’t ware out fast. these clothes are so stylish while still having a classic vibe which i love!"
j crew’s cooler younger sister. all very cute. all very stylish. all not great for my curvy self. i absolutely love the styles but not the fit. they have lot of hip options - button downs - cool dresses and clogs. i have had some success with the shoes. great style. great price!
i like the casual yet stylish boho vibe about this brand. usually been shopping at their denim section. their jeans are comfortable and fits really well and they have it in different high waist collections which is something i go for. their denim skirts are also really pretty!
"the quality of madewell is always so consistent, i love it. their styles are on trend and their price points are good for the quality. the sale prices are so great"
my closet is basically all madewell. i love their style and i also like their pieces go on sale often. they also have an extra 20-40% off sale once in a while and that's when i usually get all my stuff. they also have really good denim. they will tailor them for free too!
"i’m sad to say that the majority of my paycheck goes to madewell haha. great, fashionable clothes at a decent price. my favorite and most frequent shopped store."
i love madewell jeans. a lot of jeans i have tried fit well when i first put them on but after mid day they stretch out and do not fit properly. i love that madewell jeans look great and stay put all day long!
i buy madewell jeans all the time. they're pretty much the only jeans i wear. my shopping experience was great and all of the sales associates are so kind and helpful. it's a little on the pricy side but definitely worth it  . i would 100% recommend madewell.
madewell has one of those best customer services i have ever seen. they helped me flawlessly with my order and adjustments i had to make. they free monogramming is such a nice additional. i love my new pair of jeans they are so comfortable and exactly what i wanted!
"not the most fashionable but you can sill find great everyday pieces! the material is great so i always shop there but there jeans aren’t the best. they don’t smug well and just overall looks unflattering. nevertheless, everything else makes a good classic item"
one of my new favorite stores. i love all their jeans and think everything is pretty affordable. the only con is that the sizes are pretty big and some stuff doesn’t fit. yes i will continue to shop here.
"this is one of my favorite places to shop. the clothing is on a pricey side but it’s worth your money to splurge a little. the clothes fit so well, flattering, and extremely comfortable. i can’t stop going back to the store and i always have excellent service"
"this is my favorite store to shop in for everyday clothes. you can find some great closet staples, and everything is of solid quality. all of the stores i’ve been in are well organized and easy to maneuver, and the staff have been positive and helpful in my experience. also students get a 15% off discount 😁"
i love the clothes from madewell. unfortunately the price is very high so i can only find a few pieces when they go on sale. my favorite to purchase from here are the v neck t-shirt’s. they fit well. but be careful as they do tend to get holes with wear
"a little overpriced, and i really dislike how you can’t return items bought online, but otherwise it’s easy to find unique items that will last a long time. i don’t wear their jeans, but my favorite dress and one of my favorite necklaces are madewell."
"i love this store!! all of the clothes are so cute! i don’t shop here a lot because it is on the pricey side, but when i do i always love the purchase i make!! it is super good quality and i would recommend shopping here for sure!!"

"i love this store!! all of the clothes are so cute! i don’t shop here a lot because it is on the pricey side, but when i do i always love the purchase i make!! it is super good quality and i would recommend shopping here for sure!!"
"i love the simplicity of all of their products. as the name says all are ""made well"". beautiful leathers, sturdy jeans and twill jackets; well fitted shoes and great sales! if you haven't tried them, i'd recommend a leather bag, anorak jacket and their jeans."
madewell is usually more on the expensive side but they have super cute trendy clothes i believe that if you prefer quality than buying madewell is definitely for you i would recommend shopping here if you’re super into fashion and trendy clothes
"place has really pretty stuff !!!! especially the leather items like their totes and loafers which i love. however, the employees at these stores seems super stuck up. they won’t even great you when they come through the door ! 🙄cuz i’m mexican ?"
madewell always has the most amazing and coolest piece of clothing and accessories you can find. their leather goods are the best from their handbags to their shoes. their stuff can be quite pricey but the quality is superb and worth every penny!
"i love everything about this store. i love the shoes, bags, denim, shirts, you name it!! i have a military inspired jacket that i wear with just about everything. i love it so much that after i misplaced it i went back and bought a second one. madewell is made well!"
"madewell is not a frequent shop for me due to a lack of not having them in my area but i still have my sweater i purchased on a trip to boston. this brand can be more on the expensive side, but has lasted me years! i would definitely shop again!"
madewell has the best clothes ever! they are amazing quality and the cutest!! the only part i hate is everything is so expensive for me so that is the only downside. i have to really save to get something there but it is so worth it in the end!
"good brand for basics! they have a great selection of jeans, they feel great and fit well! they have so many options. although they are very expensive for the basics you are purchasing. these are great quality brand but could be more affordable."
"high quality denim and great size/length options. i love the style and fit of their high waisted button fly skinnies, and have them in two washes. they fit great on curvier bodies and have good stretch while stile maintaining the denim memory"
"i love the atmosphere and style of madewell. i bought a neck scarf there and i am obsessed with it. my issue is their pricing. i would love to have a pair of their jeans because i’ve heard great things about the quality, but i cannot handle the price tag! i wish they would have more sales!"
favorite jeans ever. my body type is hard to work with when it comes to denim. only at madewell am i able to find the perfect jeans that fit without extra tailoring! the style is unique and the price is reasonable for the quality provided.
"great brand, though i wish the website were easier to navigate. have purchased jewelry on sale, have yet to make purchases from their more iconic denim and leather collections."
"i love madewell! some of my closet staples come from madewell (including the shirt i'm wearing right now, which i own in 3 colors). i do wish their clothing was a bit cheaper, which is why it's not a full 5/5 rating. but overall, great quality yes!"
i really enjoy the shopping experience at madewell and they always carry and create such classic pieces with a fun flare. i’ve always had a positive experience while shopping and regularly get compliments on the pieces i find from there!
i love all of the products at madewell! their clothes are great for everyday wear but are cute enough for going out. their jewelry is very reasonable and timeless plus it’s durable. i go to madewell for birthday present or gifts as well.
"who doesn’t love madewell. i really like this brand. and i love that they have the denim program where you bring your old denim and they give you a discount toward a pair of jeans. they’re denim is so durable, classic and super stylish."
i just got a pair of jeans from there that i love! i have a couple other pieces from there too. the price point is a little high for everyday clothes imo but i love when i find a deal or can get $20 off jeans by giving them old denim.
"i always get their basic t shirts. they fit well on my petite and short waisted frame. they seem to end up with holes in them in a few months of use, but they get a ton of use. everything else is just too expensive to always purchase."
madewell is a great store with great employees. they have the best basics and the clothes feel great and are awesome quality. the main con is that they are very expensive so you cannot purchase a lot of items if you are on a budget.
i love their products and the styles they come out with each season. i love their jeans because they last a long time and fits very well.  great quality and great variety. i will shop here again and have recommended it to my friends!
"although madewell can be pricey, they do always have the best styles for basic clothing and especially jeans. all of my jeans are madewell these days, and so are my leather bags. madewell really is a one stop shop for jewelry, clothing and shoes. i usually always walk out with something."
"oh, madewell. my biggest weakness? splurging anytime i get an email from madewell saying 30% off sale. i recently purchased a transporter tote and i’m in love! i didn’t give it five stars because i wish it was a bit more affordable."
"madewell clothes are extremely soft and comfortable. however, they are expensive! i usually just head to the clearance racks which does offer great selection. i love the ambience of the store and their staff are always super nice!"
"definitely on the more expensive side, but i love shopping here. it is always an experience! they offer a teacher discount and i love my madewell tote that can also stand up to the teaching gig! i’ll always head back to madewell!"
such pretty clothes but so expensive... i usually only purchase things on sale so that i can get additional discount on the clothing i will say though that the quality is nice. i just bought my first pair of madewell jeans and i love them so much!!
"i love this brand. such classic easy pieces for your collection, they have a lot of simple cuts and monotones. perfect for a capsule wardrobe. the quality is amazing too, they really are “made well”... one of my favorite brands."
i shop at madewell for my summer wardrobe. i would shop there for other seasons too but i think they target taller customers as trying to find jeans that fit a small 5’1’’ woman is near to impossible without cuffing the jeans.
"madewell stuff really is made well. everything they sell is so timeless and cute. they have really adorable pieces that are trendy yet classic, and always high quality. they also sell cute jewelry and leather items like bags!!"
love this store. madewell has such stylish clothes that you cannot really find anywhere else. the quality is amazing and the store is so easy to shop in! they have great sunglasses and jewelry for affordable prices as well!
"i love madewell. they have quality classic pieces that last for years. it’s a tad of expensive but worth it. i don’t shop here often but when i do, i always  walk out with a purchase. i would most definitely shop here again."
fantastic basics and selection of denim. some of my favorite things are accessories i’ve purchased- their jewelry selection is very well curated. appeals to all ages- my 72 year old step mother even has a sweater from here!
love this store. madewell has such stylish clothes that you cannot really find anywhere else. the quality is amazing and the store is so easy to shop in! they have great sunglasses and jewelry for affordable prices as well!
have you ever tried on jeans that fit so perfectly and hold their form all day? well you should try madewell! it’s a perfect fit jean while still being comfortable to lounge in. i’m obsessed and hooked on madewell jeans!
love this store even though it’s pricey for a college student! the clothes wash so well and i don’t have to throw things out because they get holes in them or become pitted. plus they aren’t pushy when you try things on.
"so expensive. but also so cute. i just can’t justify spending $80 on a jean skirt that i can get at forever 21. however, i still will spend the money and feel guilty about it lol. the clothes are so cute and so well made."
"i love madewell's line, especially when it comes to their jewelry and purses. nothing they sell is cheaply made so you know you are getting a good bang for your buck. however, sometimes they can feel a little over priced."
i love the sophiatated yet clean and natural look this store has to offer. i love there jeans and the way they fit. they have so many options. i believe anyone with any style could find something they like at this store!
i ordered a couple shirts from their website and they’re exactly as they show online. the shipping was fast and the quality of the shirts is great. i would definitely order from them again and would recommend to others.
"i remember i have always wanted a classic leather jacket without the bells and whistles. i felt like everywhere i have looked, it either looked “too much” or “ not happening” 😂 but i finally found that hidden gem here."
their quality is in the name brand! great pieces! i have leather boat shoes i bought almost 3 years ago now that are still in perfect condition and looks absolutely brand new! all their merch is 100% worth every penny!
expensive but they excel in denim designs. my favorite denim jacket is from there and it's lasted me a while. what's great is you can recycle your own denim jeans there and get a discount/$$ off on your next purchase.
madewell is one of my favorite stores to shop in. i love their customer service and it makes me return more often. i shop here a ton and their clothes are the best quality! i would definitely recommend trying it out.
this used to be one of my favorite stores and i feel like they’re style has turned in a direction of being very basic pieces which is great! you always need at amazing plain white tee but you probably don’t need it for $60
"one of my absolute favorite brands. everything i have from them is the best quality and so cute. it’s not affordable at all, but it is higher quality so you get what you pay for. usually buy madewell at nordstrom."
live and die for madewell bags! these bags are made to last and stay gorgeous! i own many varieties and all exceed my expectations! a little pricey but they last forever and ever! repeat madewell shopper for life!
madewell has quickly become my favorite place for jeans. they are very expensive but the quality is well worth it. i also usually can find something good on sale. i will definitely continue to shop here for denim.
amazing quality and comfort! i bought a jean skirt from here recently and it’s definitely become one of my staple pieces! they are a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for! love love love this store!
if i could give madewell 473885 stars i would. madewell is my one stop shopping for everything. the denim is the best quality i have ever put on my body - durable and stylish. all of my leather is exclusively madewell and their collection of shoes is incredible also. hands down my favorite brand.
all my staples come from madewell! great quality. the high waisted jeans fit me perfectly and i have an irregular body pear shape. love this brand! the leather products are also amazing and very reasonably priced

i love madewell!!! if i could pick one store to describe my style it would be madewell. all of the pieces are so well made and look very professional! nothing looks tacky or bad quality simply because it isn’t!
my holy grails always come from madewell!!! their leather goods age so beautifully and the jewelry is high quality but affordable! jeans here are magical they lift your booty and don’t stretch even after a week
this is my ultimate favorite store.  the clothing is always changing and the quality is fantastic! sizes are always true.  my favorites include their leather handbags and jeans.  basics that never go out of style!
i love the lounge clothing. i have many bralettes and underwear for this brand and they are my favorite and most comfy bras. the underwear is also and i wear them all the time. i definitely recommend to people!
i’ve only bought a few things from madewell. their products are defenitly made well but they are pricey and i cannot often afford them! they do have cute and stylish products and i wish they had better pricing
"madewell is one of my all time favorite stores to shop in! their visual merchandising is great and the staff is always friendly and helpful. i love their denim recycling program, and i participate when i can!"
"how the quality of the products found at this store. seriously, everything here is “made well”, really.l great quality. price can be a bit high, so i always wait for sales and clearance. 15% off on top of any pricing with student id, minus any collaboration items."
"when i was a larger size, it was a lot harder to find clothes here. these clothes are made for tall, thin women. i thought i was done with them for that reason, but when i lost some weight, i couldn’t resist."
love madewell if your looking for perfect fitting jeans madewell is the place to go. tad bit pricy but if you bring a pair of any old jeans they give you $20 off a new pair.

"my love affair with madewell is primarily with their shirts (and a random umbrella i got there).  their basic t-shirts are extremely comfortable and balance the ""skin tight"" and ""so flowy i could be hiding a kitten under here, and you wouldn't know it"" type of shirt."
amazing quality jeans. they’re always so soft and comfortable and you can never walk out of the store without finding the perfect pair. they are worth the price for sure! i will be shopping here again soon.
madewell has the cutest clothes and bags. everything is super high quality there. i always find something there that i love. it is a little more expensive compared to h&m; or other stores but it's worth it!
"one of my favorites. great staples (tees, jeans) and also great shoes. the quality has gone downhill a little bit, which totally sucks. a lot of the stuff is expensive but they have a lot of good sales."
"i’m in love with the quality and look of madewell. everything looks so beautiful and any madewell addition to my outfit makes it look flawless. only downfall is the price, but that’s what saving is for!"
i love madewell! i normally use them for denim and tops but they have excellent every day wear. their fits are accurate and their items are well worth the money. best investment: high waist skinny denim
"this store is so aesthetically pleasing. the clothes are a bit pricey, but the quality is amazing and will last you forever. madewell is always trendy and clean looking. one of the best clothing brands!"

love how madewell jeans fit me. love the denim they use. they get it. every time. it’s a moderately affordable. haha. but it’s worth it for how good you’ll feel in their clothes. :)
"madewell is my jam when it comes to clothes. although i do think it’s a little overpriced, the quality is phenomenal. the items are classic and will stay in style for a long time."
"great updated basics, cute casual items and extended sizes available to order.  plus, the stores have a great sofa so the non-shoppers can relax and let you shop to your heart’s content!"
their quality really is the greatest. only downside is i bought a pair of ripped jeans that didn’t last as long as i would have liked because the knee ended up ripping too long.
i love this store. such high quality and a consistent style that makes you want to buy everything in the store. it offers classics and unique pieces that you can’t pass up.
there is absolutely nothing wrong with this store. has a great variety of clothes from statement pieces to staple. best of all they are all great quality and very reasonably priced.

madewell is my favorite store!!! i love all of their products. they are super great quality a little pricey but totally worth it. i have bought many items from there and am always telling my friends about this awesome store.
"if you love highwaisted jeans, you need to try madewell jeans. bring in a pair of your old jeans for $20 off a new pair of jeans. you’ll never buy jeans anywhere else."
a good place to go for cute dresses and of course denim. as the name suggests the clothes are made to last and often worth the investment. i will definitely go here in the future when i’m looking for a special outfit!
i just ordered the brown crossbody and got free shipping and free monogramming by being a madewell insider- definitely worth it. it’s the perfect bag for the city.
"i am obsessed with madewell. retro with a modern flare. and it really is made well. everything i have purchased from this store is on repeat, the quality is on point, the fits are on point and the price is right"
"madewell has a lot of really cute tops!  unfortunately, they don’t always cater to women with curves. they have great basics as well as jewelry and leather items."
madewell has great clothes but are quite pricey.  very modern look!! every time i can get my hands on a new bandana from here i am all about it!!! clean neat environment.
made well is for sure one of my favorite stores! i purchase so much from madewell and i always know that the clothes are high quality and fit me super well!! i will definitely continue to shop at madewell!
i have bought two leather bags from madewell. both of them were pricey but cute as hell. i had to return one of them-the small transport tote because it made squeaking sound whenever l walked.
oh madewell. their products are always perfect. they are up on the pricey side but everything from there will last (especially the demon). i absolutely love this store and will continue shopping here.
i bough a pants and a jacket 2 weeks ago and i
i have a ton of key basics from madewell. i love the brand! i shop here often for items to fill out my closet! just purchased a great tee and a pair of black jeans from them!
"very high quality, well fitting denim"
"madewell is one of those stores you can always rely on. especially when it comes to the sale section that is always an additional 30% off, can i get an amen. it has those classic pieces typically with a tasteful twist, and some of the best denim in the game! not to mention you can take your old jeans to recycle and put towards your new purchase! the front of the store tends to have some bold prices for the brand...but thats why imma be in the back... this is my absolute fave white button down that i practically live in!"
"i really love madewell style. they are original and trendy. their clothes is good quality, and has lasted me a while, so i feel pleased as a customer who has a great affinity for fashion. i think it suits well to young crowds like me. unfortunately, i feel they are very pricey, and for a young audience of people in their 20s, it might be difficult to pay the price. that's why i gave 4 out of 5 starts. however, if you search quality over quantity, that can validate the price increase as the clothes feels high-end, luxy. overall pleased as my main goal is original, trendy clothing and madewell has it."
"madewell is my new favorite store!! their jeans are my very favorite- they fit my figure perfectly and the prices are more than reasonable (anywhere from $98-$130). i also love that they keep with the trends but in their own madewell style. the quality is also exceptional. i recommend the v-neck tee as they're so comfortable and they look cute dressing them down or dressing them up. sales are not often but it just means people actually buy their products full price (unlike sister-store j.crew). i just hope more stores keep getting added to cities - we need one in omaha! thanks, madewell!"
"love their product lines and stores. every time i have shopped in the rush st chicago store, i was never greeted by the employees until i was in the fitting room"
"i love madewell. their quality is amazing, and that can be reflected in their pricing. i would recommend purchasing staple pieces from madewell, denim, trousers, button-downs etc. for cotton tees, i would recommend you look elsewhere, cotton items can be found with equal to superior quality from lower end stores. also, they have awesome sales but they are sales final and the best items are online which is a struggle."
"i worked at madewell and thus (was forced to) have tons of madewell clothes. they are higher quality than most fast fashion brands but madewell items are still way over priced. not only is everything super expensive, the clothes are just not flattering on anyone. women would come out of the dressing room and ask me if they were wearing a top correctly because it looked so strange and i had to just smile and suggest something else.. which is hard since so much of the inventory was equally terribly fit... nice jeans tho, if youre willing to pay"
"i love madewell! their jeans fit me perfectly. i also love the leather bags they sell. if you're ever in the dc area, there's a madewell store in georgetown- you can get a bag made there with your initials stamped on it! love!!"
"i love madewell! it’s hard for me to find things that fit my petite shape well, and madewell’s fit and sizing are great for me. i also love their denim. i’ve had a few pairs for at least 3 years and going strong, and i picked another pair this year - and i haven’t wanted to take them off. i don’t understand how they make their jeans so comfortable and cute. they make the only high waisted jeans that work on me - they almost look tailored to me, plus they’re insanely comfortable. highly recommend!!"
"my one and basically only pair of jeans is from madewell, they’re black ripped high waisted jeans. i’ve never been able to find jeans that let me look incredibly fashionable and put together while allowing me the room to stretch and adventure around town. my second favorite purchase from this brand is my mustard color bandana! it’s the perfect accessory to every outfit, whether that’s around my neck, wrist, waist, or in my hair. it adds some color and texture to every outfit!"
"i absolutely love madewell. it's extremely trendy. i like this sister company of j.crew because it's more of a casual version. also, the quality of the items here is amazing. it can be a little pricey for me at times, but i love to shop the sale racks in the back of the store and i also use my 15% teacher discount. i have spent hundreds here and it's well worth it. i have had great experiences at the maxwell in fashion valley mall in sd, ca. love the sales associates there."
"i love the pants here! i am 5’5, 5’6 on a good day, 130lbs, and very hour glass shaped with a flat butt. previously, i felt like i could only wear jeggings because sizing was so difficult. but then madewell came out with their 10’ high rise jeans and my faith in wearing pants was restored. they fit perfectly, cinching me in at the smallest part of my waist but for sure giving me breathing (read:food baby) space around my lower stomach and thighs. overall, they are super flattering and lift my flat butt. i am praying they come out with more white jeans for spring/summer. their items are made to last and can go from casual to the office. can’t wait to see their summer collection!"
i love the natural and chic look and feel of this store. the clothing is great quality and i like that they give a discount to students! i usually browse their sale section since most of their newer clothing can be a bit pricey.
i love love love love love this store. you cannot go wrong with shopping here. amazing quality on all products. it is on the pricey side but worth every penny. 100% recommend!!!
"ok so not to be dramatic or anything but madewell has the best jeans of all time. yes they are a little pricey but they last you for ever. i used to buy jeans from american eagle or hollister and pay less than $60 bucks but i never had a pair that i truly loved. now i have 4 pair of madewell jeans in my closet and i never have to worry if i’m going to like what i’m wearing. high waisted, pocket technology, non fading, cute styles and varieties!"
"i love madewell, their style is casual but trendy and they also have a lot of feminine pieces. the store is not to big where you are overwhelmed but still have plenty of options for all different tastes. the denim is so comfortable and flattering and the fabrics they use are so comfortable. prices are somewhat high but not outrageous, especially considering the quality is so great. plus they have plenty of fantastic sales."
"i just purchased a really great pair of heeled sandals with fringe for the summer! they are super cute, really great quality and i'm sure are going to last me for years to come! i'll purchase more shoes from madewell in the future."
"madewell was my first expensive (over $60) pair of jeans that had a really great fit. it was such a great experience to find a better quality jean than what i purchased in my college years! i love their high waited jeans and find their denim be great quality. i also like that they recycle their denim (you can bring in an old pair and receive a bit of credit), and their chill style is really popular in california."
forever one of my favorite stores to shop at. the style is always on point. from the amazing quality of the jeans to the leather bags and stylish sunglasses. i could easily spend serious money here. i own way over a handful of jeans/shorts from here and they have all lasted me quite some time. i also love the fact that you can donate a pair of old jeans and get money off your next purchase on a pair of jeans!
wonderful quality. customer service is fantastic. love that you can find clothing as well as accessories. very organized in store. i would definitely recommend this store to others. and i will continue to go back.
"madewell pretty much dictates my style these days. i've become convinced that they are the retail queen of style and all things perfect in the clothing world. their clothes last, so the price tag is justifiable and they have sales every so often. my only gripe is that i wish they would have better sales, ever. the most i've ever seen any item discounted is 30%. it would be nice if they had bigger sales."
madewell is a great place to go for the basics. they have a great denim and t-shirt collection- which is usually all that i will purchase from them. the price point is competitive with similar brands and i always find myself returning to their website or store in the mall to check out the newest collections.
the clothes from madewell are super cute. the quality is a little hit or miss though in my opinions. i also think they're a bit overpriced. if their prices were cheaper or their quality was on par with their prices i would definitely give 4 or 4.5 stars (please add half stars influenster!) i would recommend going to the store and trying on the clothes instead of shopping online. just my two cents!
"love madewell! i pretty much love all that madewell has to offer. i've worn everything from dresses, to tops and more recently their leather booties. my favorite purchase are my billy booties that i purchased for a recent trip to italy. they are so comfortable and very well made. i do find that madewell t-shirts stretch out quite easily which is the drawback for me. other than that, great store with quality items."
"madewell is aptly named. i have several pairs of pants and jeans which have lasted me throughout the years. bottoms are generally difficult for me being larger through the thighs and bum but i always find something that i love here. i also splurged on the cutest pair of cutout lace-up low heels that are not only comfortable for all day wear, but also sturdy enough for chasing my toddler all over the city."
"i sort of feel this is the younger version of jcrew store a little bit more affordable depending on the item there are things that are about the same as jcrew. the quality is the reason why i removed a star, i find it to be not as good as jcrew. but i still love the style and purchase things from this store, i just make sure i am happy with the item and if necessary go check it out at the store before purchasing. i don’t shop online."
my favorite thing from madewell is their v neck tee shirts. they are so soft and the relaxed fit that i love. i have searched long and hard for the perfect v neck tee shirt and i finally found it at madewell.. now to order one in every color. i am a madewell insider which means free shipping and returns which you really can't beat. no subscription necessary just sign up!
"i purchased a pair of high waisted jeans back in april. i wore them nonstop and took care of them yet somehow one of the three buttons in the front completely fell apart. i was crushed because they were truly my favorite pair of jeans. i have since stopped shopping at their store or buying their products from other retailers such as nordstrom. i honestly expected more from them especially considering the jeans were $135! sadly to say, these jeans were not made well!"
"i have recently been loving this brand. they have such cute things. they are constructed it very well and made from nice materials. if i want something i know that is going to last and look super cute and trendy i choose madewell it is a really nice brand and i’ve been buying more things recently. the price is definitely higher but you get what you pay for, quality wise!"
"madewell is my go to store for every day clothing that is effortlessly cool. their jeans are so comfortable and stretch just enough without becoming loose throughout the day, and they are made with great quality denim. also their denim trade in program is amazing and convenient. their shirts are so comfortable and effortlessly stylish and easy to pair with everything."
they remind me of the gap but in a more trendy way. i love love love love their jeans! they fit perfectly and it's super hard to find jeans for myself sometimes and they make it pretty easy. they are a little bit more on the pricey side of the spectrum especially for just offering basics.
i had brought a necklace from here thinking it was so simple and so cute and i would be able to wear it with everything. i quickly realized that i dont wear necklaces anymore just because it was not the case. i returned the necklace and got myself a pair of vans from madewell - they were a vintage white and i have been so glad the madewell has their own colors of the vans
in love with this store and its aesthetic. a little on the pricier side for everyday clothing but their sales are decent. effortless cool and tomboy chic clothing that is up to date with current trends and styles. the quality of their products is superb as well and they offer great customer rewards systems for free if you sign up to their email newsletter!
"i love this store, however, the price point is a bit high. it’s great when i have some cash to spend on clothes but not my first choice if i need to grab something to wear that weekend or evening. the quality of their clothes speak to their name! i got some boots here that weren’t cheap but i absolutely love and are some of the most high quality shoes i own!"
"madewell is a classic brand. their clothing is amazing quality and their stores are stunning. this does come with an expensive price tag though. if you're looking for staples like button up shirts, sweaters, and jeans definitely check out madewell because they really are made well. you may be paying more, but the items will last longer than cheaper stores."
"madewell jeans are unreal. every style fits me perfectly and the price is so affordable it is hard to stay no. while some of the other clothes are a little more hit and miss, when you do find a cute top it is guaranteed to fit great and be made with high quality materials. nordstrom has recently upped their madewell collection and i couldn't be happier."
"very cute clothing but sometimes overpriced for the quality. i have some basic tees and sweaters from here that lost their shape over time. their jeans are totally worth the price though, and they come in the short length which is great for 5'4"" me. their transport tote is worth it too, i've had it for 3 years and it's just as nice as the day i bought it."
"madewell lives true to its name - their products are made well! one of my favorite pairs of jeans are from madewell. my flea market flares are so flattering and hug my curves in all the right places. the quality is nearly unbeatable for the price. if you're like me and don't mind spending a little more for quality clothing, madewell is the brand for you!"
stumbled upon this store while in downtown chicago.  fell in love.  my three girls and i were all able to find the cutest clothes for each of our style.  the basic t-shirts are my new fave.  and the beach shorts i bought are super cute and comfy.  my daughter bought an army green jacket and we all fight over who gets to wear it.  the canvas bags and scarves are great accessessories.
"every once in a while i need something to wear that makes me feel special; that has an amazing fit; and makes me look thin.  when that happens, i go to madewell.  what fantastic quality; what beautiful designs; what amazing clothing.  i don't shop here regularly (my bank account can't afford it), but i highly recommend their clothing."
"greaaaaaat jeans! i had a pair from them maybe 8 years ago and they ripped pretty quickly, but i just bought a pair two months ago and they’re the best jeans i’ve ever owned. i have big hips and wear a size 29 and these are so flattering and make me feel and look great. if you have the money (100-200 for one pair of jeans) definitely try them out."
"great quality brand - as the name states: made well. it's basically jcrew's cooler sister. will continue to purchase their jeans and tops since they just about go with everything. they have unique pieces of jewelry and handbags that last. if you want to look casual but chic, this place is a must!"
"i bought the shirt-sleeve tie-front top in irene stripe. love this shirt. it is a nice yellow and white combo, making it the perfect top to brighten your outfit! shirt is very light and airy, making it a very comfortable spring/summer top. only downside is that the shirt only really goes with white pants, since it is such a light colored shirt."
#everydaymadewell is the motto . more than half of my closet is madewell . trendy.amazing quality.the leather goods are too worth it !!! oh let's not forget the denim ! anything denim at madewell is 100/10 !! go shop shop shop guys . i swear you'll fall in love !
"i have a problem. almost everything i buy is from this fabulous store. best denim you can buy. on trend pieces that don't feel too fussy. i love their relaxed, tomboy aesthetic. my leather jacket from madewell is a piece i will treasure for years to come. i refuse to buy jeans from any other store. i guess i'm in love. you should be too."
"to be honest, this store kind of intimidates me. it’s not ~ that~ expensive but you could def spend $300 on a shirt and jeans. they might last 5 years but still it’s pricey. i mostly like to go in just to get inspo and buy almost nothing unless it’s on sale. really easy to be tempted by sale signs even if i don’t actually love the item."
"madewell is one of those brands/stores that i wish i could shop at more, but i end up only buying jeans. the shopping experience is really great. it's a well merchandised & well curated store, but the prices are sometimes steep. i do love their 10"" rise jeans though. i only wear high waisted pants and they never let me down in that area."

"love madewell. my favorite piece from madewell is definitely my pair of skinny jeans. it is recommended that i not wash the jeans, and although they haven't been washed, they have held up very well. quality certainly meets comfort in their denim products. although their items are a bit pricey, for staple items, it is worth the price!"
"madewell is a must for my wardrobe, their t-shirts and basics are soft and fit like a dream... but for some reason my tees always wind up with tiny holes in them after a few wears. but i keep buying them, because nothing can beat a fresh tee from there. i am also obsessed with their high-rise denim shorts... the most comfy and cute!!"
"i personally haven't bought anything from madewell yet but i love their clothes. i find a lot of cute outfits when i shop there, but it is too expensive for me on a college budget right now. i feel like i can find similar pieces at other stores for much cheaper. even on sale their items are ridiculously expensive for what they are."
"i like madewell's style. however, i bought a cool phone case here and it fell apart within a year. it was odd that it said ""madewell"" and wasnt made well. im glad i learned tthat lesson before buying any large ticket items. im not sure theyre worth the cost. i do like their jean recycling program & wish it had a higher incentive."
"worked for madewell for about 5 years. great jeans and leather products. still have jeans and boots i purchased in 2009. sizing can be a little tough which makes ordering online difficult if you're not close to a store, but they do free delivery and free returns online. the store in garden state plaza in nj will always be my fave."
"love love love! i cannot express enough how much i love their jeans. i have such a weird figure and these jeans stretch with me without getting baggy throughout the day.  i enjoy being able to bring in a pair of old jeans to get a discount on new,   no matter the brand. i do wish their tees and shirts were a little cheaper for the quality."
madewell is great. their tshirts are super comfy and i typically try to buy them every they're on sale. they have a unquie selection of dresses and some dope jeans. it's a little harder to find jeans if you're a thick curvy girl but it's definitely possibly. i especially love their scarves. always in beautiful colors and designs.
"madewell is one of my all-time favorite stores. it's often hard for me to decide what to purchase because so many things for sale catch my eye! although the clothes are expensive, they are high quality and the company often partners with charities for good causes which is another pro. i will definitely continue shopping here."
"madewell is hands down my favorite clothing store. now that i am in my late 30's i want to dress relatively cool, but not trendy. madewell fits the bills. the clothes are cute without being over the top and cooler than their preppy sister jcrew. they also have amazing sales and extremely helpful and kind sales associates."
"madewell used to be my go-to for jeans. recently bought a pair of road tripper jeggings to replace my beloved madewell jeggings that finally ripped after a 5 year run. the quality of the pants have definitely gone down hill and i was disappointed to find that the ""tall"" size i specifically ordered still weren't long enough."
best brand out there for the minimalist women. i cannot rave more about the quality and style of this brand. it is simple the best. and if you want to go for a slightly more boho or tomboy look they have a wide variety of options in either direction.
"madewell has nice products that are well-made and last long! i have a nice leather handbag from madewell that has lasted me for a long time, so it has been a great value. however, madewell can be a bit pricey, depending on what you usually spend for clothing. it can also be difficult to find the right fit for petite women."
"madewell is the store i go to when i want that high-quality piece to spice up my seasonal wardrobe. often times i find myself in there for fall/winter because their sweaters and jeans are absolutely amazing. jeans have never fit me better before. oh, and the staff is always really helpful. great experience all around."
madewell is a great quality clothing store. i love how they incorporate classic styles and up to date trends. they make beautiful products that will last. i love the fit and styles of their jeans and they're denim recycle program is a great way to trade in old jeans i don't wear anymore for credit towards a new pair.
madewell almost doesn't need a review. their name was selected with purpose and serves as a mantra that they are devoted to. the quality of their clothing is their focus second only to the devotion to highly chic trends. every time i make a purchase at madewell it feels like an investment i am making in my wardrobe.
the worlds greatest shirts! i'm a plus size woman and i love the fit of the tshirts. they are soft and hold up over time. i highly recommend going into a store and trying different things. i've been working on my weight loss and have a pie of madewell jeans as my big motivator. i'll update this review once they fit!
"i'm in love with the design of every madewel product, less in love with the price however. i find it hard to believe that i should ever pay 400 dollars for a dress, but i'll stick around for clearance time and snag it up for a considerable amount less. if you can stomach the steep prices your closet will be happy."
"i usually shop at madewell during sales. i cannot recommend their sales enough, you can get some really great deals!"
"madewell is an up and coming trendy store that has some great capsule pieces for your closet. however, the prices are so outrageous at this store for some products. for example, i got a plain white t-shirt from there that was a super soft cotton material, but the price tag was 70 dollars. a little over priced."
"they provide really cute, fashionable, and classic pieces for any wardrobe. most of their clothes are reasonably priced, especially their pocket tees, which i love. i wish their was a store closer to my house, but that makes the shopping experience a little more special, since it cannot happen all of the time."
"i love madewell to pieces, but they are so overpriced it is almost laughable. this seems like a less well known free people, at lululemon prices. i do find that their clothes and accessories are well made (madewell, well made?) but i can’t get past the price for what seems like clothes i could get anywhere."
i purchased a monogrammed bag there and it's totally not worth the price i paid. the straps and ridiculously short and the leather isn't very thick. i should have researched comparable products before spending what i did on this. i love some of their pieces but you're paying a serious image and atmosphere tax when shopping there
"i recently bought a pair of madewell  jeans thru amazon and they are amazing. the fit is great, being someone that struggles to find the perfect pair of jeans they were soft and fit great. they do tend to run small or at least the pair that i bought. i will have to go to nordstrom and try on different pairs."
"madewell really lives up to their name. any item of clothing that i have purchased has been wonderful quality and long lasting. their jeans are the most amazing pieces for way less than what you'd pay for designer jeans. i'm a t-shirt type of girl, and i find myself reaching for their t-shirts again and again."
"madewell is my ultimate summer clothes one stop shop. i love the relaxed, comfortable feel of their clothes. every time i wear my linen capris from them i always get stopped and asked where i got them. also love their shorts. best denim shorts that flatter my lengthy legs without looking like booty shorts."
hands down my favorite clothing brand! i love everything they have in stock and wish i could afford it all! the quality of the clothing is amazing! this company is definitely on the spendthrift side.. but if your looking for great quality clothing and fashion.. this is definitely the right store for you!
"madewell is recently my new favorite place to buy jeans! they are very flattering and feel of high quality. they are expensive, but a worthwhile investment since they will last. the last time i shopped there they were having a 20% off one pair of jeans so i'd say just watch for sales when you go to shop."
awesome store with soo many cute things! i wish i could purchase everything here. the store is very expensive however so i try to limit my visits as i can often find somewhat similar things at target for half the price. this is a very trendy and cute store that i will often stop by if i am in the area.
"i love this store. my favorite pair of jeans are from here, and although the store is extremely expensive, the quality of the products is pristine. whenever i spend money here, even though it may be a lot, i make use of the purchased products extremely often. i especially recommend the denim from here."
"madewell denim is second to none. it fits so beautifully and stays new looking for years. it is a little pricey, but it worth every dollar. the store is beautiful but the site is great and user friendly too! the only thing with shopping online is not being able to try on. sometimes sizing can be a little weird"
"i’ve been buying madewell clothes since i was 18 (i’m 26 now), so for them to keep my business through many different life (& style) stages says something! i like their sweaters and tees, although i’ve kind of stopped buying their jeans because the denim is always kind of thin. now i only buy levi’s."
bought a white tee from madewell and i really love the fit and material. it is really hard to find a white tee that fits well. bought from j crew but ended up returning it because i didn't like the fit but this one from madewell just fits great. wraps around my shoulders and doesn't look too boxy.
"this store has amazing sales.  their clothes are really good quality.  they have changed recently, i used to fit very well into the majority of their clothes, but i think due to 'trends' the cuts of their clothes no longer flatter me.  i still buy all my purses here though, they have great leather products."
"love this store! i first discovered it when i lived in san francisco. i was in college at the time so i couldn’t afford to shop there often, but the things i did buy from there were worth every dollar!  i still have my favorite bag from there which has held up for nearly 10 years now of frequent use!"
"love made well, one of my go to shops. their denim is a fave and has great fit for girls with curves too.  good quality products for the most part but overpriced for the quality of most items. a lot of items go on sale so it’s worth waiting to see if something your eyeing will go on sale"
"made well is def jcrew’s cooler younger sister. i love the fit they have and really all their clothes and jewelry and handbags. their leather handbags are a staple in my closet and get a lot of use. i love the collaborations that made well does from time to time. great jeans, best tees in the game. never close madewell!"
"jeans jeans jeans! my favorite jeans are my madewell highwaisted skinnies. so flattering and so comfortable. i work in an office, and was afraid highwaisted jeans would be too uncomfortable to sit in all day, but madewell has proven me wrong. i will always come back to madewell for their jeans!"
madewell is simply made so very well. my favorite basic jean shorts are from there as well as like all of my go to t-shirts. like all of them now that i am thinking about it.
"madewell is one of my favorite brands of denim for a reason. the quality of every piece they make is fantastic. i still have jeans i bought four years ago that look brand new!  i've also found that the staff is excellent- they are knowledgeable, and great with helping find exactly what you need."
"amazing quality, sophisticated look, but way out of my price range. a typical shirt is $75 while a casual dress is typically $175. so although i'd love to shop here more, i don't see how many people can afford this place."
madewell is fantastic. they always have such classic jeans and stylish looks at an fairly affordable price. i really appreciate that they honor student discounts and always have everything organized in the store. they also allow you to trade in old jeans for a discount on new jeans- yes!
"madewell is j.crew's sister brand. i like to think of it as a bit younger, trendier, and kind of like free people version of j.crew. the customer service is always top notch and they also offer free heming for all of madewell's jeans, as well as a 15% student discount with a valid student id."
some of my favorite jeans are from madewell. i find that they give you a nice shape even though the models are always skinny and tall. i’m kinda opposite. i have been disappointed on their durability. i do over wear my madewell jeans but i do have cheaper brands that have held up much longer.
"madewell is my go to store. i love that you can find classic, but trendy pieces that are well-made here! their denim is definitely my favorite, and nothing beats their t-shirts! i will be a forever customer!"
i do love the style of clothes that madewell has but i personally think their prices are too high. they position themselves as a more affordable version of j crew yet their prices are just as high. the quality of clothes is great! i think they are best known for their denim which i am not a huge fan of.
this store doesn’t have a whole lot that i would consider to be “my style” but i have purchased a few things here. my best friend got me a beautiful faux fur jacket here and i wear it all the time. this store is great quality for the price.
"love this place, the sales associates are always friendly and helpful. i think they could improve their pricing for some items because sometimes their pricing doesn’t match the quality. they have really trendy pieces and a great clearance section. also have a teacher and student discount!!"
"i have a few scarfs and a shirt from here. they are expensive but there is a reason! i like that it’s quality, ethical, and they are making efforts to reduce waste. they even have a jean recycling program which is awesome. i don’t shop here a ton because it is pricy but i love their items."
"the name tells all in this case: great clothes, purses, and shoes that are made well! very expensive, but amazing quality. i have had some of their clothes and bags for years. beautiful leather work, and their sales aren't bad either. great store for investment pieces to last a long time."
i would own so much more madewell if it was less expensive! their stuff is well...made well! great quality. i recently purchased earrings that i fell in love with!!! bought at nordstrom’s! decent price.  very comfy on ears too!
"great store for high quality, staple items. they sell tons of minimalistic items -- great for someone looking for an item that will go with anything. the quality is great but the prices are a bit higher than i would hope. i still recommend shopping at madewell -- keep an eye out for deals!"
"definitely a pricey store, but worth it for the quality of the clothing. their jeans have an amazing fit and they offer free alterations. the girls at the store by me are so kind and friendly, they know me by name. the sale rack has crazy affordable finds and is always where i go to first."
madewell is my favorite clothing store. the clothes are definitely my aesthetic. my body type isn't very suitable for the clothes though. i'm not very slim or tall so some of the clothes fit me weird. it definitely seems to be more suitable for people who have model-like bodies.
"madewell is a beautiful brand that puts out classic items that become staples in your wardrobe. they produce, tailored looks that you can dress up or down, for a night on the town or for an effortless breezy look in the day. my go-to's in the store are the t-shirts, jeans, and cozy sweaters in the fall. ⭐"
"if i could have an endless amount of income, i would buy the entire store every season. the clothes are super cute and trendy but also classic. the high waist jeans are my favorite and so are their bags even the weekender and the leather shoes are so comfy. take all my money madewell."
"i love madewell but it's hard to find the flagship stores in my area so i haven't bought that many things from there. however, the clothes are very cute, a little pricy but the jeans are the best part of the store. they fit like a glove because they have great options in terms of sizes."
i love this brand. i would say it has a similar vibe to cute boutique shops or even urban outfitters but more sophisticated. it is on the pricer side but their denim all have such great quality. i'm obsessed with this designer brand and can't wait to buy more pieces for my closet.
madewell is my favorite clothing store. the clothes are definitely my aesthetic. my body type isn't very suitable for the clothes though. i'm not very slim or tall so some of the clothes fit me weird. it definitely seems to be more suitable for people who have model-like bodies.
"my absolute favorite place to shop. they have the cutest casual dresses and comfy shoes. they also have a student discount, which can be applied ontop of sale items as well! everything is cute and great quality. they always have sales so wait for that because they can be pretty pricey!"
"i am short and wide (5""4' with 40 inch hips and a 28in waist) and it's super hard for me to find jeans that fit. madewell's not only fit me perfectly but are super stylish! i also love their button ups and sweaters. the tees are kinda flimsy. shoes and bags are stellar. this is my all time"
"madewell is definitely... made well. not really my everyday shopping store, but when they have their sales and extra % off sale, i definitely spend time browsing their racks and their online store. if you're a student, be sure to have your student id so you can get an extra discount!"
"i love the quality of the clothing even though it is a little pricey... you get what you paid for. however, the shopping experience is not always great. sometimes the employees are not helpful at all. however, i will still probably shop here and i would recommend shopping here too!"
i love madewell's designs. their t-shirts are my favorite and they are the only brand i buy. their sweaters are so soft and comfortable. i pass a madewell everyday leaving starbucks in the morning and i can't help but stare at the window displays and dream about their clothes.
"madewell is one of my favorite purse stores. i recently bought the travel tote in brown and it is my new favorite go-to purse. it is high quality leather, very durable, and only gets prettier with age. they are more expensive, averaging $150 a purse, but they are worth the price."
"this the cutest store on the outside and i love the style of the clothing. it is classy and clean, but very overpriced. i think you could find a lot of similar clothing at other stores for far cheaper. maybe go to madewell for special occasions or as a treat, but not for everyday."
"this is my favorite brand. everything is of great quality and classic. you can mix and match all of their products and always feel comfortable and stylish. the prices are a bit steep for what you get, but the quality far outweighs the price. their tshirts and jeans cannot be beat!"
"i'm a huge fan of madewell's trends. the only drawback about this store is that it is fairly pricey and depending on what you're getting, you could be paying more than $75 for a top. however, they do offer a great rewards program as well as a 10% discount for college students!"
such a beautiful brand. i want every one of their purses. i have a brown leather crossbody and it is what i use everyday. it’s beautiful and i get so many complements on it weekly. the price is a little more expensive but you get a quality item when you buy a a madewell purse.
"i only ever go to the sale section in the back of this store and you always have to use a student id to get the extra discount. the normal priced clothing is ridiculously expensive but the deals in the sale section can be really great, especially for t-shirts and unique items."
"go here for the jeans. period. they will last you forever and they have different cuts that flatter all shapes. they are such high quality!! tip: if you're looking to get rid of an old pair, bring them to their store and they'll give you a discount on one of theirs!!! amazing"
"i love shopping at madewell for basics like jeans and t-shirts. the jeans are my absolute favorite -- high waisted, stretchy but don't lose their shape, and come in a longer length for tall girls. they're definitely worth the price! i haven't found jeans that fit me better."
"such a good product for my sensitive skin. bottle is really cute and nice to give as gift. is was so soothing to my poor over used skin. will buy lots again.  fantastic, garuntee to please! i hope they sell a bigger size in the future or gift sets! maybe expand on scents too."
"madewell jeans are heaven clouds that you can walk in. best jeans i have ever owned! also bring in a pair of old, no brand, cheap pair of used jeans and you’ll get $20 off of any new pair of jeans at the store! they use the old pair to make installation for housing! awesome!"
madewell is the perfect place to go for the cutest and trendiest styles! their selection is always great and their clothing is to die for! plus their shoes and accessories are also amazing! i always fall in love with everything in store and can’t wait to go shopping again!
i am obsessed with madewell. i find that the quality can’t be beat and they constantly roll out classic pieces that are perfect for a capsule wardrobe. some of my favorite tops and dresses have been purchased from them and i can’t wait to get my hand on some of their denim!
madewell has the cutest bandana scarves for a great price! some are even as low as $12 and can add so much more to an outfit. everytime i wear one i get so many compliments. i love their simple yet fashionable style and how you can mix and match so many of their pieces.
"i highly recommend madewell denim, as they fit like a dream and can be quite affordable during sales. all of my madewell jeans have lasted through years of impromtu beach swimming, backpacking trips, and house parties. they are trusty, flattering, and long lasting."
"a little bit on the splurge side, but if you're ever looking for pieces that are well... made well then you've come to the right place. i've bought the denim here and it's one my favorite pairs of jeans i've ever bought. they're super trendy and always fit like a glove."

i love this brand! i love the style with that everlasting summer style of the effortless cool girl! i love the jeans just wish they had more variety on styles with them instead of high rises and skinny but overall the brand is very good especially for those summer days!
"this place is pricy but has the cutest clothes and other items! if you're looking for good quality clothes that are super cute and will last a long time, this is the place to go! they keep up with all of the latest trends and like the name says - it's all made very well!"
madewell is a great brand that takes too much of my money. they product quality items that i know will last for a while. i've found some of my favorite jeans from madewell and they have the cutest tops too. they'll always be a brand i don't feel bad spending money on.
"a very trendy store, but more on the expensive side. they have some nice items and clothing but honestly you could find very similar clothing at a cheaper cost, it just won't have the label of being for made well. however the quality would be better, so if you're looking for long lasting than you should invest. also you have to take care of the clothes, for instance you can't just throw it in the wash, some of their clothing shrinks. i received a sweater from their store in december and i didn't read the label and i shrunk it a lot. also i bought an phone case from there and let me just say their case are more for style and are fragile. overall the clothes are nice and if you want to buy i would say if you aren't growing anymore than shop there because their clothes will last as long as you take care of them. but for the accessories and others at the store, i know there would be other places with similar design at a lower cost."
"i love this company. all of their clothes are such classic pieces. prices are high, but you're paying for quality and for pieces that you'll be able to use for as long as you fit into them. i recently bought a denim skirt from here and am inclined to wear it every day!"
"great quality clothing and the prices aren't too terrible if you want the quality! only problem i had is that with my cotton product, they had to washed in a super delicate cycle or else they loss 'fresh' look."
the name says it all! their quality is outstanding. they even have an old denim exchange for a discount off of a new pair of jeans. my all time favorite jeans are from here and have formed so perfectly to my body it is like they were made and tailored just for me.
madewell is definitely one of my favorite stores. i love the items in this adorable little shop and have been able to find some items that i truly wear that will last with great quality. madewell carries original pieces and that's truly what makes it fun to visit!
madwell is the best off-set jcrew has created. i love their casualware as well as their leather goods products. the workers there are always willing to give me advice on different clothing items. i wish they had petite friendly items like their sister store jcrew.
madewell has such great style.  their jeans are amazing and are always the perfect fit.  they are really well made and last a long time.  i also love their bags.  they are very sturdy and super trendy.  definitely one of my favorite places to shop!  i highly recommend it!
my go-to shop for every t-shirt i own! i love this brand and have never been disappointed in a purchase. my favorite items are the t-shirts (keep your eye open for them to go on sale!) and a maxi dress i stumbled upon in-store on the markdown rack. check them out!
"madewell is the best and they totally live up to their name. everything is made of such quality, and brings your basics up to another level. i've also never been to a madewell where i didn't want to be besties with the girls who work there. worth the value for sure!"
"my go-to pants are madewell jeans.  they are the softest and most comfortable pants i have ever owned and have recommended the brand to friends and family.  unlike most places, the pants fit my butt, legs, and waist, without getting them tailored."
"i absolutely love madewell style. the laid back comfy chic is my go to look! the only con is how stinking expensive it is, however the quality is undeniable so i see every purchase as an investment in a forever piece of my wardrobe! love love love this place!"
"jcrew's slightly cooler, slightly hipper, slightly younger sister. when i still want to keep a little of my edge but want to still be able to expect nice quality madewell is my go-to. a little more urban than jcrew but they kill it with there cool lines & cuts!"
best jeans! i love the variety in style and the different fits and washes. madwell is my go-to because of their high waisted options and if you sign up for their newsletter they offer free tailoring and a discount on personalized stitching. lots of choices!
i just knew about this brand recently. i brought two of their pocket t-shirts and i fell in love. they are made well no pun intended. the quality is very good and helds up well in the wash. the material is afoot and comfy. it's affordable if you a long lasting shirt.
some of the madewell jeans fit excellent! they have great styles and always have distressed or raw hem denim which is cool. the selvage denim is great too. less expensive than most designer denim which is awesome as well. some do not have a lot of stretch which can be annoying though
"one of my favorite stores. mainly for the denim, bandannas and some of the shirts. i think a few items here and there are a little dated or corny but i just skip over that for the good stuff. i also generally wait until things i want go on sale before i buy them,"
"gorgeous items that are great quality and acceptable for everyday wear. they use quality leather, have beautiful and interesting pieces of jewelry, and it's a great place to buy jeans. be ready to spend a lot, unless you make it for one of their great sales."
i just bought sunglasses from madewell and i can't put them down. i love the vintage feel and the great quality. they were definitely affordable and effective for what i was looking for. i would definitely shop here again and i recommend it for others too!
this is one of my favorite brands. the fit is really excellent and the sales are great. their selection of jeans is amazing. my only complaint is that their jean styles tend to fluctuate with the trends and sometimes my favorite styles are no longer there.
"madewell’s clothing is incredible!! everything is adorable and amazing quality. i love their jeans especially! they fit perfectly and have a great stretch to them. the only thing is that the clothing is very expensive, especially the basics like t-shirts."
love most of their clothes and the quality is usually great. although sometimes the fit can be a little weird depending on your body type. but love their great customer service and they're always very helpful when you have an issue with your online order.
can we talk about their amazing jeans for a minute? usually when i get home i cannot wait to rip my jeans off and get into a comfy pair of sweats but with madewell jeans i can lounge around my house in them with no discomfort! the cali demi is the best fit.
"i love the clothes, shoes, and jewelry at madewell! it's kinda pricey, but the clothing is such high quality that i think it's worth it! the store i go to, is not the friendliest, i don't think i've ever been welcomed into the store or helped unless i ask."
my favorite place to buy jeans or any denim products. they are always high quality and the customer service is great! i got overalls there and i love them so much! the jeans i've had for several years still look brand new. and they offer a student discount!

"i love madewell. the clothing is so cute. they’re known for their jeans but the dresses, other clothes, and accessories are adorable. i adore their shoes. i’ve had a pair of their sandals for years and they still look new, i highly recommend this store."
"the best clothing store for women - in my humble opinion. madewell clothing is exactly that, made well. the quality is outstanding and the shopping experience is great too. i highly recommend joining their rewards program for free - it totally pays off."
"things really are made well here. they last a lot longer than other clothes or products. their leather is wonderful. their clothes are super chic and comfy and cute. if you are a student, you get a discount on top of your members discount. so do both!"
"madewell jeans are my new favorites. after visiting their brooklyn location, i became obsessed with the fit and look of their summer jean styles and look forward to buying more pairs soon. they also have a tall section which is perfect for long legs."
"madewell has very high quality items. the bar i work for catered one of their events which they provided chambray shirts for, and they are so nice & very well made. it does sit a little on the pricey side of the spectrum, but you get what you pay for."
"i want to give madwell 5 stars for beautiful cloths, shoes and bags. the prices seem high though and the jewelry always turns. i do but the nice jewelry styles when they are on sale though. i shop there a least once a month! they have classic styles."
"sign up for their insiders program! helps track how much you spend there and comes with perks, like $20 off during your birth month! students also get 15% off, which i frequently utilize on sale. i have their transport tote and i carry it everywhere!"
"the quality is better than j. crew, but the styles are hit or miss. sometimes dresses are too short, sometimes the fit is too boxy, etc. on the website, everything looks great but once i get it sometimes clothes look like vintage psych ward dresses."
"the quality is better than j. crew, but the styles are hit or miss. sometimes dresses are too short, sometimes the fit is too boxy, etc. on the website, everything looks great but once i get it sometimes clothes look like vintage psych ward dresses."
i have several skinny pants from madewell as well as a pair of overalls. clothing is high quality which i tend to buy when on sale. their clothing is straight forward and almost a little androgynous feeling. clothes are not overly girly or frilly.
this store is  one of my favorites. the only reason i'm giving it a 4 star rating is affordability. i love the use of basics and neutrals that can be reword over and over again and layered to create different looks. i wish it was more affordable :(
this is my favourite store of all time. all of the prices are worth it and i have bought over half of of my wardrobe from madewell. i recommend this store to literally everyone and i love everything from their denim to their leather products. 11/10
madewell is awesome. it is similar to jcrew and has amazing jeans. if youre looking for a pair of overalls they have some that will blow you away. the stores are clean and easy to navigate. id recommend madewell if youre willing to spend a lot. it is very expensive.
"this store is so me, but so expensive. i love the clothes and i often find myself walking in here and admiring but have yet to convince myself that the $200 sweater is worth it. no hate for this place, but i wish the prices were more attainable."
"i  was disappointed with a t-shirt i bought. it fell apart after a gentle wash and one dry. the seems fell apart and even random holes in the material. however, i didn't enjoy a cotton clause i purchased, even if it is a little short (i'm 5'8"")."
"great place to get really well-made (ha) items but it can get pricey. i rarely buy items unless they're on sale. having said this, it's worth the investment for how long-lasting and high-quality madewell clothes and accessories are. overall a good brand for cute, easy casual wear that you can throw on to look chic without trying too hard."
"i just really love madewell products. the pieces i buy are usually one-of-a kind. i shop there at least once a month, sometimes even twice. my favorite items to buy there are the dresses. my con for madewell is the prices. sometimes i think they are too pricey, but i still purchase items from them, because the quality is really, really good."
"one of my favorite stores. madewell carries my favorite denim, makes the most comfortable shoes, and the bags and jewelry are timeless. i know i will keep many of my purchases forever. this store is for anyone lookin for elevated, classic pieces."

"always an exciting trip to madewell! the epitome of classic cool for 20, 30, and 40 something's. great quality at an affordable price, and the sale rack is always worth a look. clothing, shoes, jewelry and other accessories are all top notch."
madewell feels like good vibes. it's dressy and causal and effortless. i've never been disappointed with their quality and get compliments on many of the pieces i own from them. i love the aesthetic of their stores and it's fun shopping there!
"madewell is great, just wish it was more in my price range. i've bought a phone case from them which was very good quality leather and was just beautiful. i always watch for sales because i love their clothes, just a little too pricey for me."
"madewell has to be in my top 3 favorite stores. their clothes are beautiful and so well made. i think it’s important to spend a little extra money and buy well-made products that will last a while. not only this, but their clothes really suit lots of styles. you can find great pieces whether your style is bohemian, preppy or grunge. definitely check them out!"
definitely great items here and there. i love the vibe in the store and the style of their clothes. not everything fits me the way i hoped but the things i do find are comfortable and look gorgeous. their jewelry selection is top notch too!!
"a little expensive for a college kid budget, but come christmas time my family knows that's where to get the best presents for me! the clothing is made so well and last forever. all the clothing is true to size and will always be my favorit"
love madewell's jeans!!! so unique and comfy. their staff is also bomb. they are always so helpful in helping me find my right size and give me honest opinions of what looks good and what's not so hot. me and my bestie shop here all the time
madewell has the cutest clothes. i've gotten some of my favorite work dresses there but also some of my casual weekend clothes. the quality of the clothing is great. they also have some of the best accessories. i highly recommend madewell.
"the best part about madewell, aside from their constant sales, is their selection of jeans. they have consistently high-quality jeans in all different styles and colors, and their magic pockets really are that slimming. worth the price tag!"

"i love this store so much! i'm a huge fan of their purses, they're very cute and very durable. their clothes are also incredibly cute. it is expensive to shop here, but if you're willing to shell out the cash, i would totally recommend it!"
"i truly love this brand! madewell is top-of-the-line for a leather products. one of my all-time favorite staple jacket is madewell , that i've had for years. i highly recommend trying madewell products! very fashionable and excellent quality."
"their high waisted jeans (9 or 10 inches) are heaven sent. i don’t feel comfortable with anything lower anymore. i feel confident my belly/backside isn’t hanging out, things tuck nicely into them and the skinny versions are so slimming."
madewell is amazing! i love their shirts - they are perfect for teacher outfits! the tops from madewell are great and always worth the money! i shop here regularly and a lot of my friends shop here. they do a lot of promotions for groups!
love madewells products. they are so cute and last a long time. the store is beautiful and have great items. it is pricey but will last you a long time.  the customer service is not great and i have sent emails complaining about being mistreated.
i love madewell's design. most of my wardrobe is from madewell. their denim fits really well and love that they carry high-rises. the prices are a little high but i guess you get what you pay for in terms of design and quality.
great jeans that are relatively good priced when compared to other high end denim brands. they fit great and have many items with a 10 inch high rise which is amazing! they get loose around the waist sometimes but they are still great
i love this store so much. all the clothes there are so soft and are of such great quality. the style at madewell is simple yet beautiful. the have a wide range of sizes  from xxs to xl. i will continue to buy my clothes from madewell!
"this store as cotton fabric galore! everything is fitted and a little retro! i am obsessed with the quality and timeless style! their t-shirts are he foundation of my wardrobe. jeans are good too! love their shoes, wallets, and purses!"
"my all time favorite jeans are from here. the cali-modern have a super soft denim that i could wear all day long. i have the light denim shade, which feels fresh. the hem is distressed and shorter in the front. i adore these jeans!"
love love love any and everything from madewell. no other denim store has styles as cute as madewell. you will pay a decent price for them but the quality is worth it. check for sales as they have them often making it more affordable
amazing quality clothing and the absolute best jeans around. even for my curvier frame the denim fits amazing. i love how timeless their clothes are and i've held onto many pieces for several years and they are still in amazing shape
i shop at madewell quite a bit. they always has the cutest stuff and their jeans always fit like a glove! there pieces are always so classic and timeless. i always get compliments on my clothes from here which is always a good thing
"i love madewell. i gave it 4 stars because of how expensive it is. their clothes are all so cute and go with a lot of things. this is one of my go to stores. it is great quality, especially their jeans. i would recommend this store!"
this is my ultimate store. they have unique classics. they offer size14 and the prices are excellent. the dresses are great for a women in her 40's summer shirts last and wash well. they're shoes are luxurious and fit well. jackets are fashion lovers dreams. i love this store and shop here monthly. it's simply divine
the clothes are high quality and never fail to impress me! it is a bit pricey but it is always nice and lasts a long time. i would splurge if you have some extra cash. i never have had a bad experience shopping here! i would so recommend!
made well is super nice. i love all their t shirts and sweaters. everything is such a nice material and i like to buy things from here when there’s a sale since the sweaters are my favorite and they can get a little bit expensive.
love madewell! all of their stuff is super cute - a little out of my budget for everyday shopping. when i see something super special i keep my eye on it and see if it does on sale. love their shoes. their jewelry is the best!!
"i love madewell!!!! amazing products, amazing prices, especially when they are on sale! great quality, beautiful pieces. everything i buy there, i love. i did get a tee that is very light and comfy. will always shop at @madewell"
i found out about madewell a year ago and i am so glad i found them. i love their jeans! you can return an old pair of jeans and they will give you a discount on tour new pair. they also have decent sales so watch out for that!
"i love madewell!!!! amazing products, amazing prices, especially when they are on sale! great quality, beautiful pieces. everything i buy there, i love. i did get a tee that is very light and comfy. will always shop at @madewell"
i’ve recently gotten into madewell due to some bloggers. i’ve purchased some of the whisper cotton t shirts and really like the colors and fit. i like how it holds up well in the wash. i can’t wait to try more of their clothing.
"although a bit pricey for me, if you can splurge for great quality it is 100% worth it. there products are made to last a lifetime, and they are confident in that. there plain sleek style is perfect for trendy rear round living!"
madewell is the cutest! i walk through the store and love just about everything i see. high quality stylish clothing items. pretty expensive but worth saving up for. i am always always always pleased with my madewell purchases!
"okay so the clothes here are super cute and, because of the expensive price, are good quality.  the reason i didn't give it five stars is the fact that there jeans do not hold up overtime.   but there sales are always the bomb."
just bought my first pair of jeans from madewell and i am in love with them. they have the perfect amount of stretch and are super comfortable. i love that they have high waisted jeans that aren't completely ripped to shreds.
"great place for all the basics you need in your life. wish it was a little less pricey on certain items, but they do have frequent sales and the quality is good. i buy things from here every now and then when there is a sale."
"madewell jeans are the best! they offer free alterations in store which is amazing, and their fit is great. the price point is a bit steep, but i think jeans are really an investment staple so it is usually worth it for me."
it’s called madewell because it’s just that: made well. this stuff lasts forever. it’s beautiful and classic. i go at least once a week. a little pricey but worth it to have something that holds up through multiple washes.
i adore this store everything os so cute and great quality!the store does carry more expensive clothing ($60-$180 per item) but everything is actually made well and will last for a couple years! i’m totally shopping here again!
"big fan of madewell. some of the products are better quality than others. always wait for them to go on sale - everything eventually will go on sale at this store. also, they have a 15% discount for students and educators that stacks on their sales."
it’s called madewell because it’s just that: made well. this stuff lasts forever. it’s beautiful and classic. i go at least once a week. a little pricey but worth it to have something that holds up through multiple washes.
"madewell makes quality long lasting products. for example, one of my favorite clothing items is a pink, knit lightweight sweater i wear almost year round. it's lasted over 4 years. i do prefer to buy their clothing on sale."
love madewell!! one of my favorite stores. i prefer to shop online after visiting the stores and trying things on. i get free shipping and other fun things from being a madewell insider. i always recommend them to friends.
"if you’re looking for something that will last, madewell is a great option. i purchased a lot of my work dresses there and they’re a great material that doesn’t wrinkle. they’re pricy but great for pieces you’ll wear over and over."
madewell is one of my very favorite stores. i'm am always so in love with everything in the store but it is so expensive. this is a great place to find high quality basics and summer clothes. i highly recommend this brand.
i love madewell. they have the cutest laid back clothes at a decent price. everyone is always so nice and willing to help and they truly have great customer service. this is definitely my go to store for everyday pieces.
"madewell is seriously a dream — i love the aesthetic of their store along with the quality of the clothing! the store is always running great sales, so it’s more affordable than most people assume. i got a skirt for $15!"
first found this store one or two years ago. instantly became my best fitting jeans! love that i can trade in my old ones for a discount and love the fit! they are a little pricey but jeans seem to be that way these days.

beautiful style and aesthetic if only i could afford a single thing in the store. if i was a millionaire i'd dress exclusively in madewell clothing. from the tote bags to the jeans every bit of madewell fits an aesthetic.
"jeans, jeans, jeans!! they last forever. they almost always require some breaking in, but when you get them there, you won't ever want to wear anything different. love them, just wish they were a little more affordable."
love this store! it has very beautiful clothing! it can run on more of the expensive side. i shop here every so often & it never disappoints! it’s clothing is of great quality as well & i recommend others to this store!
"their name says it all!!!! everything is quality and clean. great leather products, dresses and more. i love the muted color scheme for their clothing. favorite shoe is the boardwalk sandal! will shop here all my life"
madewell has really great jeans and leather products. i love their simplicity and classic lines and designs. the leather bags are amazing quality and you know they will last. i love that their jeans don't stretch out.
"madewell makes good basic clothing. i like their jeans. they’re study, affordable, and flattering. they don’t tear or stretch out too easily which is a plus. i don’t shop here too often, but never regret it when i do."
"madewell gets me and my flannel, casual, uk obsession. everything in that store is cool as can be and has this vibe to it like they aren't trying too hard, but come out with amazing pieces that are very quality. absolutely love checking in on the latest styles as i know i will always find something :)"
the clothes here are really cute and usually well made. i’m pretty basic when it comes to clothes and they really market to an easy going jeans and t-shirt aesthetic. i appreciate them being sold at nordstrom as well.
i love this store! i’m short and have wide hips and small waist and i always have a hard time finding jeans but their high rise jeans fit my body so well! they’re pricey but they last forever. highly recommend them.
"i have a pair of gold hoop earrings from madewell that are my favorite staple earrings and i wear all the time. however, their clothes are very pricey for what they are so that deters me from shopping there usually."
amazing quality and worth the price point. their design and overall feel is perfect if you are the effortless/chic type. it is on the higher end. it their pieces are well made and are long lasting. totally recommend.
madewell is one of my favorite stores for those staple pieces like a nice pair of everyday jeans or plain blouses that go with everything. it’s a great place to shop for casual clothing items as well as accessories.
"i only started shopping here recently and i had no idea what i was missing! great jeans and really cute tops, dresses, and accessories as well. their clothes are great for when i want to have a cute and casual look!"
"i absolutely love madewell. it's j crew's refined, hipster older sibling. if i had to wear one brand for the rest of my life, it would be madewell. sadly, their prices mean i can only afford a few favorite pieces."
"madewell is one of my favorite brands. i will only wear their 10"" jeans with the reinforced pockets. one of my pairs wore through on the inner thigh, and the store exchanged them for a brand new pair no questions asked."
"seriously feel like a magazine model while wearing madewell. definitely a favorite, but again, unfortunately, i don't have a store in close proximity. definitely prepare your wallet, but the clothing is beautiful!"
"i really like madewell, but it's always hit or miss for me. they have great basics, and the shopping experience is always great. one thing i don't love-nothing ever stands out, they don't have that ""wow"" factor."
always one of my favorite places to shop whether it's for myself or friends.  their denim is amazing and so are basically every piece of clothing you will find there!  can't wait to order again highly recommend it!
"great store for all those casual, comfortable staples. prices are a little higher, but that's because of the quality. this is the only store with 100% cotton items that don't pill, snag, or shrink in the dryer."
"although expensive, you are definitely paying for quality. i've been carrying around my cognac madewell tote for 2 years and there's hardly any signs of wear and tear on it at all. i still get compliments on it!"
"great quality clothes at semi-affordable prices. their denim is my favorite — i love how their jeans fit me. like i said, it can be pricy but everything always goes on sale. great for buying wardrobe staples."
i can't say enough about their customer service and products. there is a reason for the name. they truly are made well. the iconic leather hand bag you see everywhere is what caught my eye and kept me coming back!
amazing quality. amazing customer service. way over priced but since their clothing (especially jeans) fit my body perfectly and hold their shape i am loyal. i won't buy jeans from any other store. will always shop here.
"such a high quality store with fantastic everything. seriously. it's my favorite. i cannot wait to get some madewell jeans soon! they are pricey,  i know they are worth it. everything i've bought from here was!"
love the simple chill attitude of madewell. their clothes feel so quality when you put them on. but their prices match for sure. i feel strange spending so much for a blank shirt. great quality though.
i am a teacher and i love that i am
my all time favorite store!! i can't rave about the quality of their products enough! good products to invest in because they will last years! the sale section always has cute options if you are on a budget!
"definitely overpriced as a brand, but i really dig their aesthetic, which is down-to-earth and simple. if you get their tops and tanks on sale (which they do give massive discounts yay!), they are a great investment: the material is soft and thick and flows over the body nicely."

"i love this store! they always have the top trends in clothes, shoes, and jewelry! the quality of their clothes is great, they are usually very structured. everything i buy here is a win and always get complimented. would recommend!"
"i am loving madewell right now. their name states exactly what their products are- made well! my top three picks from madewell right now are the silk bandanas, the jeans (obvi), and the leather tote bags!"
"this is such a high quality store! all of the products are great and i love them. however, the price tag is pretty steep. i love the j crew brand and i always feel trendy shopping here. i would recommend."
"one of my favorite brands and stores. affordable, stylish, quality clothing that can be worn anywhere. it really speaks to my style and i love that you can donate old jeans and earn $20 towards a new pair."
love love love love the jeans quality! they have end of season sales that are amazing ! love the jewelry but i wish it wouldn't turn silver so fast! overall the quality of jeans for the price is amazing.
"a great place for pants and accessories. expensive, but great to hit during a sale or for one or two special items! their shirts, however, are not terribly well cut- i think i've only even bought one top here."
"they have some nice, high quality items but these are overshadowed by their more"
"they are over priced and use sweatshop labor, but their clothes are cute, but not quite worth the price. i use to shop there more but i am not a fan of the environmental and human cruelty they stand for."
"i’ve bought very few things from madewell because it is so expensive, but what i have bought has been excellent quality. the store gives you a very relaxed vibe. i would love to shop more with madewell."
madewell jeans are the best jeans i've ever owned they fit so well and the length is perfect i also love their sweaters sizing runs a little big so you can order most things a size down to fit normally
"madewell is awesome. pretty much every item is something i love. the quality of their products great, so i understand the price point is a bit higher for casual wear. i only wish they had better sales."
"ethical fashion is tough to find. jeans that fit and look amazing are also hard to find. this company has solved your problem. try them out, don’t focus on the price tag, and you will never look back."
i've become recently obsessed with madwell and almost everything they offer!! the workers are so helpful and usually nail exactly the look you are going for. i always stop here on my shopping trips!!
i love this store so much. they are my style inspirations. i think their customer service is great and love the fact that they have a student discount. i think they're true to size and great quality.
"madewell has amazing denim. it is a little pricey but very worth it because of the fit, quality, and durability. i love their other items too but sometimes they are a little ordinary to be so pricey."
"madewell has the best and most durable denim i have ever purchased. even though it may be a little pricy, you can literally live in these jeans and they’ll still be in good condition. i recommend."
i love madewell but the prices are outrageous. i love the clothes and have no problem spending money on items i feel are worth the money. but i can't find anything in there that's worth the money! i have to wait for stuff to go on sale. love the clothes but overpriced.
"overall love madewell. their jeans are to die for and i love their tops and tanks. also i am in love with my large transport tote, so i now buy them for all my friends when they graduate college"
i just love everything about madewell. i love the minimalism of their clothing and accessories and i think the price is very good for a made in the usa product. i would buy everything they make!
"i love their affordable everyday essentials. they have a great line of bags, dresses, tops, plus some comfy and stylish shoes. i do most of my buying online and their return policy is very easy."

amazing jeans; i have a hard time because of my shape finding jeans that truly fit and their jeans always win for me. i also love their tees! such an amazing tee that some brands just can’t get right!
"high quality clothes that are on trend and effortlessly classic and casual. really comfortable and fun to wear. a bit pricier, but worth it for the quality. great accessories as well. love it!"
like with h&m; this style is one i am just getting into. the subtle yet stylish vibe it gives off. i think the quality is great and it is pretty affordable compared to most places i shop. i am very happy with every experience i have had there and i would shop again.
"i have a madewell blanket scarf and it is my absolute foavorite it is soft and fabulouly warm, totally recomend this store and if you are a college student you get discounts just bring you id."
made well is my go to place to buy high quality basics that i know i will use for a long time. it’s a bit pricey but what i have bought are my staple pieces and they have yet to let me down.
great classic style with a twist. a little overpriced but always on trend. they got something for everyone. sales associates are almost always very friendly. music in their stores sucks though.
madewell is one of my go-tos for basics and closet staples! the only complaint that i have is that the sizing is off for me! i will try on the xs/s and some items will still be boxy and huge on me!
as far as quality! yes  you do get what you pay for. it's a bit on the expensive side but they have great sales. coupons once you sign up. favorite purchase is a grey scuba shift dress. i would shop again.
absolutely love this brand! it has such feminine pieces that are so classic! the quality and materials are great! purchased one of my favorite gingham navy skirts that i wear all the time!
"i like this store when it has a sale. cute, fashion-forward, good quality clothing but a bit pricey. i am always excited to go in the store and always happy with my items! adorable shoes!"
"one of my favors brands!! i’m a cute pair of jeans, nice shoes, cute jewelry, & a t-shirt kind of gal & madewell is my go-to for tops! they are great quality & affordable. they also fit so well"
too expensive usually for what the actual product is and how it is not always “made well” but it is always stylish and on trend. i’m glad they offer student discounts and have good sales!
"love this stuff! honestly, couldn’t,ask for a better product. it does everything i️ want it to do. decent price point too. it totally exceeded my expectations. definitely would recommend this product to my friends"
love this store. clothes last long without fade! they are really made well. can catch a good sale here and there. clothes will last for years plus. denims is nice more for people with less curves
"i adore madewell. the styles are trendy and classy, with a bit of edge. their quality is amazing...however, i'd say their prices can be a bit high at times. i do love their sales though!"
though it's a bit pricey you can seriously not find better quality products in clothing i shop there all the time and when i exit this fabulous store i surprise my self with tons of bags
"i love shopping at madewell, even though the prices are much higher than i can afford. but that doesn't stop me from trying on their clothes and shopping in the sales section! their clothes are always really nice quality, and well worth the sale price!"
madewell is a great brand! they have high quality clothing but it also can be at a higher price than other clothing stores. i recently bought a scarf there on sale and really love it!

my absolute favorite store hands down. more than half my closet is made of madewell. i love the amazing things their denim does for my butt/legs and their tops are always so cute! not to mention their leather goods are a steal compared to other places!  i have everything from shoes to hats from madewell.
"madewell is the ultimate stop for quality pieces. if you're going for the tomboy or minimal look it's the place for you. madewell can be pricy, but their pieces will last a lifetime!"
one of my favorite stores to go to. good quality and their denim selection is amazing. it fits and hugs your body in all the right places. they have a good sale when the time comes.
i have one madewell purse and i'm obsessed . i price is about 100.00 and up. but there are totally worth it ! i've had a purse from them for over a year now and it still looks brand new! i totally recommend shopping here!!
"madewell is one of my all time favorites. super trendy, crisp and comfortable clothes. the cost is pricey but i always know i am getting quality clothing. whether i need something for every day or a special occasion, i always start at madewell."
my absolute favorite store. you can find cute things in every department from  phone accessories to dresses! the only drawback is that it's very pricey but their sales are perfect.
this store has such cute clothing. they're very classic and the store in very spacey and organized. the pricing is pretty steep on some products in comparison to their value though
just like j. crew- this brand is high quality. they have great styles and their handbags are a staple. i have their tote bag and i get tons of compliments on it all the time.
"i love madewell! i have only owned their shorts and tops, i have yet to indulge in a pair of their jeans. they make quality products for amazing prices! their sales are the best!"
love their jeans. it’s so comfortable and really caters to your individual shape. it is pricey so that’s why i can’t give it five stars. it is out of my price range as a student.
"madewell carries great casual pieces for your wardrobe. with a wide range of items and prices you can find that perfect tee, boyfriend jeans, shoes, bags, accessories and more! check their sale racks regularly, they are always adding things."
"my favorite brand of clothing. quality fabrics used, incredible jeans, great customer service, and great sales. jewelry is quality and they work with the community to give back."
"i love madewell! i have only owned their shorts and tops, i have yet to indulge in a pair of their jeans. they make quality products for amazing prices! their sales are the best!"
great quality clothes! soft material that doesn’t get ruined easily. shoes and leather products are also good material. everything is super cute and appealing. love this brand!
madewell is my go to store for all things casual. whether i'm looking for jeans or a quirky tee they've got it all. all of their products are high quality and last a long time.
"i'm giving it a 4star because of the high price point. i've never bought anything here full price because they always have great sales anyway. i bought my favorite jeans here for about $40 and they're usually around $125. i refuse to buy jeans anywhere else because they just hug you at the right places and they have the right amount of stretch. the quality of their products is amazing, and if you take care of them, they're truly investment pieces. and they also give 20% off student discount that can be used on top of their sales!! amazing"
great quality with a high quality look. very pricey. if you want to spend some big bucks on nice denim do madewell. they do charity work that may make it worth it. probably not.
madewell is my favorite store and it's basically my goal to make most of my wardrobe madewell. just bought their overall shorts and have been wearing them nonstop for summer!
madewell is j. crew's cool little sister with the more hip styles and the trends you like but aren't sure how to wear. their jeans are killer for the price and the experience is always enjoyable. i wish they offered more shoes though.
"this is the best store for every day basics - tanks, tshirts, and denim! you can't go wrong if you purchase basics.  also, they have pretty cute jewelry and other accessories."
"i only go to madewell for their jeans. my favorite pair is the high waisted white jeans. it fits so well, except the length. they don't have jeans designed for shorter women."
this brand lets me look youthful and put-together at the same time. i love the colors and the high quality fabrics. the styles are trendy and look great on nearly everyone!!
my absolute favorite store. some things can be pricey but they have a totally unique look with so many unique pieces! their bags are great quality and will last you forever!
madewell is my favorite store ever! from their satchels to their jeans and clothing! it’s a little pricey but every piece i have stands out in my wardrobe and lasts forever!
"i love madewell! i shopped from them more often before i left my full-time job to go back to school but can always find a couple of steals when they email me about a sale. i am obsessed with their pocket v-neck tees. i have about seven of them. i was always on the quest for the perfect tee (maintains shape, doesn't pill, colors stay fresh) until i found them. i have a purse from them that just looks better and better the more i wear it in. my only item that i do not purchase from them is their denim. the color fades too quickly for my liking and they are loooong ( i am 5'6 and typically am fine with jeans as long as i don't purchase ""talls"") so i have to get them hemmed which is an added expense."
the quality of madewell’s products is great and the styles remind me of the 70s but with a classic bent. the prices can sometimes be a little steep but the sales are good.
i have only purchased a tshirt and i definitely see the difference. it just fits and looks better than my others. looking forward to trying out more stuff from this brand.
such amazing basics and unique pieces. i love the shoes and accessories. the whole esthetic just speaks to me. everything is clean and bright. they have great denim as well
basically just the younger and trendier j crew. the quality of the denim here is incredible. i always know i am getting a quality purchase when i buy my jeans here.
madewell is seriously my number one place to shop bc it’s so modern and edgy! i just love the styles the come up with every season and always look forward to the next!
overall i love madewell because it’s a lot of the pieces i’m “missing” when i shop j. crew. the clothing fits well but at times i don’t feel it is made the best way it could be.
"love this store!! such good quality clothing from jeans, shirts, sweaters, and dresses. love the style and how simple it is. one of my favorite stores to buy clothes, has such a good selection and love their clothes in every season! the jewelry is super cute and minimalistic too! good for college students to adults in there 30s in my opinion! great quality for great prices, most of there items go on sale so i just wait until the sale. they have lots of great sales on clothes from the same season so love that too! they have some great leather items as well. they have a loyalty program now too, free to join and as you spend money can be upgraded to get more perks!"
"i discovered madewell a few years ago and it has become a staple in my closet. it’s high quality, decently priced, and perfectly trendy! i’m never dissatisfied with my purchases and highly recommend."
"the more livable side of j. crew, madewell is the place to go to stay on trend with quality clothes! from accessories to clothes, madewell is easy to fall in love with."
madewell is such a great brand. i own a couple of dresses and purses from them and they still look amazing. worth the splurge and they always have great staple items.
"madewell has good jeans, i'll give them that. everything is far too expensive for the look of the clothing though. i find madewell to be too simple to be so expensive"
"the style is truly on point with current trends and my style, but i know i have to get it when i see it if i want it, and it is most likely going to be a tad pricey."
"this is my favorite clothing store next to nordstrom.  love the fit of their clothes.  lots of work appropriate but appropriate for play as well.  i could live in their chambray shirts and jeans.  their leggings are also amazing quality for leggings.  however, don't splurge on much full price.  their stuff always goes on sale and then sale will ultimately go on sale.  plus they have a student/teacher discount.  shop smart there.  great clothes, but don't spend full price.  you won't have to."
madewell has super cute clothes and accessories. it’s expensive but your going to get what you pay for. i don’t shop there a lot cause most things they have aren’t my style but it’s super alternative and cute bags
"this is my favorite clothing store next to nordstrom.  love the fit of their clothes.  lots of work appropriate but appropriate for play as well.  i could live in their chambray shirts and jeans.  their leggings are also amazing quality for leggings.  however, don't splurge on much full price.  their stuff always goes on sale and then sale will ultimately go on sale.  plus they have a student/teacher discount.  shop smart there.  great clothes, but don't spend full price.  you won't have to."
"i absolutely love this store. i has fun, hip, trendy clothing that has a classic feel to it. madewell makes the best jeans ever. i'm fairly petite with larger hips and thighs. these jeans have solved all my issues. they're the perfect length and style. i truly cannot say enough about how much i love this store. it also has student discounts and a program where if you bring in a pair of damaged madewell jeans, you will receive a $20 credit to a future jean purchase!"
i love their jeans! they are so well made! made well is my go to shop for that effortless look that i didn’t try too hard when i worked to put an outfit together.
madewell’s jeans is the best jeans that i’ve ever purchased! best jeans purchase ever! i have the roadtripper jeans and it’s so comfortable and fits me perfectly.
new to madewell but love their jeans and t shirts a lot. one of my favorite basic white t shirts is from here because it has great shape and not too see through.
"there are some good basics here with a trendy twist, which i like, but i find the quality to be pretty abysmal overall for the inflated prices. for a sweater in the $125 dollar range, i at least expect it to be made out of reasonably nice materials like wool, mohair, angora, alpaca, cashmere, or a blend of some of the above. or even cotton. but at madewell, that price point gets you a sweater (albeit a cute one) made of synthetic nylon or polyester that's really not much better than what you find at forever 21 if you look hard enough. and when the sweater does contain a nice material like merino wool, it's so, so so thin that they clearly cheaped out and used less than premium raw materials. that's why i never really shop at madewell anymore. i can get better quality and comparable design for my money elsewhere."
"i go to farewell for their choices in jewelry. they usually are simple brass options, but they go well with each and every look, and they are good for everyday wear"
madewell is a go to brand that pair style and comfort. their tees are especially wonderful for summer occasions and the jeans are some of the best for the price.
love this store. great handbags that aren't that expensive for the nice leather they're made out of. they have really cute clothes too. i think they're best known for their jeans but i have not tried those.
love this brand!! the cloths are high quality in general and great value for the price! not to mention they are very comfortable.. i love to purchase them during nordstrom sale!! i love the basic tee!!
this is a review of the amazing leather madewell tote.
"i first discovered madewell about 9 years ago in ct at a sidewalk sale. i bought a few items and fell in love. the fabric was soft and the shorts fit me so well. i also loved the colors which are more earthy toned. with that being said, i went into a location about 6 months ago and was shocked to see their skyrocketed prices. i couldn't bring myself to spend that money on basic type clothing. i haven't gone back to the store"
"i love the look of a lot of madewell pieces, but to be honest i always have found the fit to be really strange! madewell, which feels like it's more for young people (really everything here is relatively casual and basic-- nothing too extravagant or bold), is the sister company of j. crew. i shop at j. crew a lot, where the clothes seem to fit me well, but for some reason every time i try on something at madewell, i hate how it looks!"
"i have recently been shopping at madewell a lot! i love their tshirts. they wash super well and are extremely comfy. i also love their jeans. they fit nicely without being overly expensive. i would definitely recommend shopping here if you are looking for casual clothes that will hold up in the wash. i highly recommend waiting to purchase things on sale, they often offer a 30% off additional sale and you can score some great deals!!"
it is good brands with good quality. i think it is my favorite store in the world. all product is made by them very adorable. i love shopping there. i like effects after using products from there. i will recommend my friends
"the name says it all. made well. i love the quality of clothing that i receive from this company. their clothing and their bags are classic and hold up in all of the conditions that i put them through. i love their different styles of clothing and their pieces change frequently. sizing wise- i would say that they are true to size so if you are on the edge of a size, go to the bigger size."
really love this store. everything is so tasteful. it only has four stars cause sometimes things can be pricey for what they are. i get that the nicer pieces are more expensive (obviously) but sometimes i find things that i think should be way cheaper. my favorite piece is probably a single earring i bought of a hand. i love it and it doesn't irritate my skin at all!
"this store is adorable- it is a sister store to j.crew, but caters to younger women. the store has great classic pieces such as jeans, their leather ""transport"" bag and even shoes. i find madewell to be pricier than j.crew in some ways and they seem to have less sales. recently they had 50% off all sale jewelry and i got a great necklace for $4. definitely a store to check out."
"my favorite store. everything in there is a staple that i ""need"" for my wardrobe! the clothes are extremely well made and classic pieces. i love that everything fits true to size too."
"madewell has adorable clothes. i love their denim particularly. their tees are very cute as well, though a little expensive for my taste. i have generally been pleased with the quality of the items i've purchased here. and i own one of the famous madewell totes, which really is fabulous. it is made very sturdy and i'm sure it will last me a long time."
"if i could pick one store to be clothed in forever, it would be madewell. i am so in love with everything they put out, it's just so well put together. the vibe of the store when you walk in is inviting, the employees are polite and knowledgeable. they put together such great outfits too! the quality of their clothes, purses, shoes, jewelry, everything is just a+."
"i've shopped at madewell for years. i do truely love the quality of all their items, especially their denim. i have bought denim around a similar price point at other stores and they will wear out in a year or less- so disappointing. not madewell denim!! i've had a beloved pair of slim fit jeans for more than two years now and they are still in excellent condition. the style of madewell's clothing is easygoing and classic, and i always get asked about the pieces i'm wearing."
"i own so many shirts from madewell, and the quality is always top notch. it can be pricey at times but that's what sales are for and madewell takes sales super seriously! all my basic shirts are from madewell and i highly recommend"
love love love madewell! such a big fan of this store and the clothing! the jeans are comfortable and long lasting and all of the clothes are high quality and super cute!
"i’ve had the best customer service experience with madewell. an expired discount code was honored with no issues and in a quick response time! also, the best fitting jeans that hold their shape through multiple wears! love this brand and company!"
"by far one of my favorite stores for shoes, clothes and jewelry. everything is responsible priced and lasts a long time since the quality is great. for example my grey oversize sweater has lasted 3 years and i where it all the time. while it may seem a bit pricey for staples you only need to purchase them once!"
this store has such quality garments that range from amazing jeans with a unique trade your own jeans for their program. one of my favorite products are their unique jewelry style work statement jewelry to subtle trendy pieces!
"love this store, the style is super cute, clean, and trendy. they have a lot of basics, i think the quality is very nice. i have the leather tote in purple with my initials monogrammed on it, i always get compliments. my only complaint is that the bag itself is a little on the heavier side because its entirely leather."
"i love madewell! it is very similar to j. crew. all of the clothing items are very cute and high quality. the only drawback for me is the price. you definitely pay for the high quality. i also dislike how the sale items online are 'final sale', so you cannot return items that do not fit you."
"madewell is my new favorite store!  it has a very vintage yet classy homey feel that passes from the store into their products. my favorite things to buy from here are the cardigans and the dresses. they are truly so adorable and classy, i always seem to get compliments on my outfits whenever i wear madewell clothes. although pricey, it is definitely worth it! whenever i stop by the mall, i have to go here!"
"how ironic that i'm currently wearing a shirt from madewell while writing this review! their clothes are very cute and preppy, but less preppy than their sister store jcrew. some of the clothes id definitely overpriced, so i usually wait until they go on sale. i don't spend my money on full price pieces there because i'd rather invest in timeless pieces from somewhere else. cute clothes, too pricey."
"i love everything i've gotten at madewell. classic and unique pieces that are high quality. my only complaint is that many of their tops (blouses and sweaters) are made to be very boxy and baggy, so they don't have a very flattering shape unless you have a specific body type. i do not have that body type, so most of the time i have to size down two sizes or try an item on in the store before i buy it to make sure it won't look frumpy."
"i love love love madewell's clothes... they have super cute and classic pieces that will last you a while. even their jewelry is great, i have a really cute worn gold necklace i wear all the time. my only qualm is that the prices are so high, but sometimes you can get stuff on sale."
i am obsessed with madewell. i used to work at their store in soho and i currently work at j. crew so i might be a little biased but i work for the company because i love it so much. their clothes have such great quality and fit my personal style perfectly. their leather bags and shoes are especially fantastic. i love how the clothes are styled and they are such great wardrobe staples. favorite store!
"i recently shopped at madewell and was impressed with the styles - lots of cute things in a variety of colors. the quality of the things i tried on was good and the price point was really great. if you are looking for basics with a bit of style, this is a great place to check out!"
"relatively new to this brand (introduced to it through trunk club) and have only purchased t-shirts.  a little pricey for a normal short-sleeve shirt ($19.50), but i can definitely tell the difference between it and others.  very soft, did not shrink with the first wash, good length (i do not like or wear short shirts), and a variety of sizes.  i'm hopeful to find other pieces from madewell.  recommended."
"i love madewell! i personally find j.crew way too expensive and not nearly as fashionable as this sister brand. they have great sales and i'm newly obsessed with their denim. my tush thanks you, madewell 🤗. i think my only problem is that sometimes i find they have only a few colors (very neutral and simple) so i have to be careful not to only shop here or my wardrobe might be a bit bland."
"i recently bought the most amazing overalls! i've been looking for perfectly fitted long denim overalls for years, but have never found a good fit. these fit perfectly and with a denim purchase, you are eligible for free alterations! the price was steep, but the quality is amazing!"
"madewell's denim is some of the best i've ever owned, even though i own many pairs of 'designer-brand' jeans. i think they have an inclusive size and height range and they keep classic styles while adding in some more daring/trendy cuts. i like their underwear and bralettes, too. i think they should offer more sales like jcrew as sometimes their clothes can be a bit expensive"
"high quality staples at a decent price—every time i visit madewell, i might as well be waving a white flag that says, ""please take all my money!"" their denim and leather goods are expensive but comparable to their competition. i have never regretted a purchase from them."
madewell is the best! i love the high quality of the clothes ! the style of madewell is so different from other store that are their competitors ! my favorite purchase from madewell is any vneck tee i have purchased from them! i will most definitely shop at madewell again!
"madewell's designs are great - classic yet trendy. unfortunately, i have to give it three stars because with the exception of a purse, every item i have purchased from madewell has ripped or broken in a different capacity. it makes me really sad because madewell makes such nice things, but i'm now a bit more reluctant to shop at madewell because i haven't seen great quality items."
"madewell has some really nice clothes, think jcrew but a little bit more edgy. the only problem with this brand  is that the products aren't the best quality and the prices are pretty high. i think the products are on par with express so if their prices were there it would be much more popular. as for me i prefer to pay designer affordable prices on actual designer products."
"the name of the brand says it all. i use to work for madewell and i can really say that as a company they really do care about the customers. no is never a answer for them. however, madewell is slight over priced. if i was to get one thing from them would jeans. their jeans are the best splurge you will even make. you can tell its made from quality because it’s all handmade."
"love love love love. buy me literally anything from madewell and i'd be thrilled! love the americana minimalistic style and the quality is absolutely fab. denim, button ups, and jewelry will always be spot on! you can't go wrong with a madewell choice."
"i really like madewell - from their style to the quality of their products. they're owned by j.crew and have pretty much the same sales. i always use my student discount on top, which helps out! i love everything i have from madewell and will be shopping there more frequently."
"i always shop here. great denim, classic urban style that is the larger j crew brand but with a twist. you can donate your denim for insulation and receive $20 off your next denim purchase.  if you're a student or teacher, they honor a discount with id. they always have sales. they're clothes are made of cotton, silk, jersey, leather, suede...real materials that will be staples in your capsule collections."
"i love the brand madewell! it is very similar to j. crew, except more youthful. it is a little more on the expensive side, but the clothing is made well so it will last longer. i shop here for bags, dresses, and cute tops! i would definitely recommend this brand to anyone!"
madewell is my number one favorite clothing store and their jeans make your booty look better than any i have ever owned! now i only buy madewell denim - i like them better than my 3x1 and ag jeans. the aesthetic perfectly encapsulates our local cool-girl style.
"love everything from madewell! their selections are fantastic too! a little pricy but be on the lookout for coupons and deals from them on occasion! their sizing is also spot on! i adore shopping online, as they have a lot more sale items than in store!"
"love everything from madewell! their selections are fantastic too! a little pricy but be on the lookout for coupons and deals from them on occasion! their sizing is also spot on! i adore shopping online, as they have a lot more sale items than in store!"
madewell is probably my favorite store. they make high quality pieces that are fun and trendy yet still very comfortable. they also have sales going on frequently and offer a student discount in store with your student id! their jewelry is also my fave!!
i really love the aesthetic and quality. however i find the sizing and fit to be inconsistent. luckily everyone working at my nearest store is very helpful and attentive. i can always count on them to help figure out the perfect fit!
"love madewell products. honestly the best i've ever bought. they make the shopping experience fun and personal. its not the most affordable product out there, but it sure is a really nice brand with really good products. would recommend everyone shop here."
"when madewell says they know jeans, they know jeans. their jeans are so flattering, but more importantly, feel so good. they're sturdy, yet elastic, and the high waist makes it so comfortable to move in. it doesn't matter what you're doing - sitting, dancing, running. your jeans are sure to move when you do - and all that excess flab stays tucked in too!"
"absolutely one of my favorite brands! the quality, the comfort everything is just amazing. i wish it was a little cheaper, but the quality and fit is well worth the price."
my favorite tote bag is from here and i had my initials place and it's just the softest leather ever! also i love their jeans. they are the most comfortable pairs i own.
"madewell is my favorite store. just peering through the window does not do you any justice. you have to go in and look at all the clothes to get the jist of things. i have everything from there: the bra/panty sets, coats, sweaters, skirts, tshirts, tanks, shoes, shorts, anything you name i have from madewell. their products are definitely made well!"
love the jeans one may even say they’re made well.. pun intended. they never disappoint with quality. the don’t have any locations near me but when i’m in boston i make it a point to go there
i recently purchased a pair of boots from madewell and have been hooked since. a lot of their clothing is pretty basic but the pieces are fantastic quality and last through multiple seasons. the prices can be a bit much but i feel that it is worth it.
"madewell jeans are thee best!  they can be pricey, but i always purchase mine when they are marked down.  their jeans are made of high quality denim which holds up after washing and drying.  they hold their shape through out the day, and are perfect for petite ladies like myself.  extra perk, they offer a nice little discount for teachers!"
"i am somewhat of a madewell superfan. i love keeping up on their trends as they change from season to season. their clothes are going to be more nordstroms pricepoint than macys, but i found that shopping here has helped me achieve my goal of buying fewer items less often. they also offer a great discount for students and teachers."
"i love shopping at madewell for staple pieces. they do tend to be pricier, but they are worth the money for the quality you get. they hold their shape after wearing and washing, and most pieces can be paired with other items to be dressed up or down. my only issue is that i am very petite and most of the clothes run large."
"i'm new to the store/ brand, but i love the feel and the quality of the clothes. i have two pairs of jeans from them and they both wash and wear really well- super stretchy but they maintain their shape, and they are incredibly comfortable. and i love how when you donate a pair of your old jeans, you get $25 off a new pair!"
i got the 10in high waisted pants and they are a favorite!!! i think all their jeans are awesome! my friend has an adorable pair of their short overalls and they are so versatile. they sold out of them quickly! so if your'e trying to decide on something after trying it on... get it.  you will regret it if you don't!
"i don't know where i bought jeans before i found madewell. the fit is always perfect, and they always provide classic and trendy styles, so i can create a unique, practical wardrobe. i can't stop shopping once i find jeans either. the rest of their clothes are beautiful. needless to say, i have plenty of madewell in my closet!"
"farewell jeans are my favorite jeans. they have a ton of styles, cuts, colors, weights. how the jeans are constructed is always high quality so they last and last."
"higher prices, but you're paying for quality. i wouldn't buy the ""next big thing"" here, it's definitely too pricey for trendy pieces. buy your staples here, and follow them on social media for promotional materials (coupons, flash sale notifications) if you're on a budget. seriously, this stuff is the real deal."
"madewell has the best basics for going to class or for a work environment, or dressier going out clothes. i shop here frequently and are obsessed with their jeans, those are my favorite things to purchase, i would shop here again, and their prices are a little on the more expensive side but the quality if great!"
"if my life was reflected by a brand - this would be it! the team that works at my local madewell is incredible. the clothes are amazing quality. they’re prices are a bit high but if you capsule shop like i do, then you are willing to splurge a little on pieces that you’ll keep for years to come! love this store, recommend for everyone!"
"madewell is probably my all time favorite brand. it's comfy enough for everyday wear and dressy enough for business casual. the quality is usually worth the price, but i typically only shop sale unless it's a special occasion. i've purchased everything from plaid shirts, jeans, dresses, tees, shoes, and jewelry."
i love madewell.  they have the best fabrics and great quality clothing.  they also have the best new fashion trends and i know i will be looking great in any of their pieces.  i am also in love with their shoes and how comfy they are!  i always can't wait to see all the new items madewell has in their stores.
"madewell has everything you need from bags to close to jewelry to shoes. the prices are a little higher than i'd prefer but the styles, fits, and quality of their products really make it worth it. their bags are my favorite, they have everything from an every day cross body bag to duffels for traveling!"
"useful tip: bring your student id and enjoy 15% off everything in the store -- including sale items! madewell has the best tees. seriously the best. and the coziest socks. i've never sprung for their jeans because i'm a lucky brand girl, but their sweaters and tops hold up really well and feel of quality."
madewell is by far one of my favorite stores. their customer service is amazing. their quality is great. they always have good sales or codes. their stuff is so cute and the fit of their jeans are amazing. i am j brand loyal fan but the designer of j brand actually creates madewell jeans. they are fab.
denim denim denim my go to denim spot! all i have to say is high quality and that you will get your money's worth. i am not a crazy shopper when it comes to denim because it can be pretty expensive but having a pair of madewell jeans is a must. they last a long time and they only get better with time!
"i have only ever bought one shirt there, but it has lasted me for about 2 years. the clothes at madewell are quite expensive, but they seem to be great quality. they also tend to give student discounts, which is a bonus for me. i will definitely go there again when i have a bit more money to spend."
this store is everything. i love their jeans and the quality feels amazing. definitely pricey but work every penny. they also have really cute accessories and home stuff for your desk or home office. i love it their.
"love love love this store.  they always have the cutest clothes and its different all the time, which is right up my alley.  the clothes are unique which is just what i like.  i wish the prices were cheaper though."
i love the styles at this store. i feel like some of it is over prices. but they do have sale items year round. i love how they have vans and other shoes that are exclusive to madewell! i also like their jewelry
"madewell recently opened in a mall in my city and it is absolutely amazing. i love all of their clothes. it's expensive, but it's worth the price! everything is made with good quality and it fits perfectly. plus, they can hem free of charge! another great plus is they offer college student discounts!"
"you can tell from the store that they are selective with their products and pieces. i would agree that their stuff is good quality but it reflects in the high prices. for me, who loves to find trendy things, i want the store to have a wide variety and madewell has a pretty small selection."
"one of my all time favorite stores. i can always find something i love at this store which is why i try to stay away. i can't go into this store and not buy something. they have the cutest clothes that are high quality. it is a little pricey, but not crazy. cutest stuff at madewell."
"madewell makes the best, and i do mean best, jeans that i have ever bought/owned! the boutique caters to their clients and are more than helpful with finding a size and or style that will suit you best. the quality holds up better than any i have ever owned. after three years, my jeans still look brand new! highly recommend!"
i love this store. i love the styles. they don't go for overly trendy. just generally stylish so you don't have to worry as much about things going out of style. the clothes i buy from here always last too.
i like madewell but i think it is overpriced. i hate that they do not let you use j. crew gift cards and vice versa despite being owned by the same company. i also find that madewell's clothes tend to have a boxier fit and end short on my torso. this is a hard store to shop at if you are a tall girl.
madewell is my favorite place to shop. hands down. their quality is great 99% of the time. they are always on point with trends without being too trendy. their denim is amazing. i haven't purchased denim from anywhere else in about 3 years. they run great specials from time to time.
"a little on the pricey side, but the quality of their clothes is totally worth it! i have had amazing luck in their clearance section and the clothing i have are some of my favorite staple pieces in my wardrobe. highly recommend shopping there and becoming a rewards member (many perks)!"
"wonderful quality jeans. they have occasional 30% off sales. their knit sweaters and jeans are definitely worth the price. they have very cute, simple gold minimalistic jewelry. 4 stars because of the price, but their products hold up very well. i have a wool cardigan from the store."
"their name describes their clothing, everything is made well. they are pricy but everything lasts and their basics are timeless. you can wear their clothing at any point in your life. you should try on everything because for the price you are paying you do want to get the perfect fit."
if i could have a closet full of their clothes i would. madewell is truly made well and i cannot say enough good things about this store. my favorite purchase was a leather tote. their bags are made to last. i still have mine from a year ago and it's not even close to being replaced!
"i love,love, love madewell! yes, they are pretty pricey but their pieces are so timeless and so cute and, dare i say it, made well (hah) but in all seriousness if you're willing to spend some extra cash a a really quality staple item for your wardrobe i highly recommend madewell."
"i love madewell. the quality is great and they have great everyday staples. however the price can be overwhelming, but if you go through their sale sections they have pieces that are reasonably priced and cute. also they do have a lot of sale so keep your eyes open for those."
"aesthetic. soooo much aesthetic. it's hard to find quality clothing without a lot of graphic prints. simple beautiful clothing with a decent size range,as i am a 12-14. i think the style caters to a specific demographic (it makes total sense they're under j. crew), but i love them."
"madewell reminds me too much of j.crew for me to find them particularly memorable. it's high quality but expensive basic and classic pieces. they're well made (pun) but the price point is shocking, i personally would rather get cheap basics because these are nothing memorable"
i've only purchased a few things from them but i love them all. their boyfriend button ups are the comfiest thing you'll ever wear and their t-shirts are awesome. i did have one that got a hole after the first wear but they're reasonably priced so i'll just get a new one.
"i love madewell's clothes and accessories. my favorite part of this store is they always give a teacher discount! there quality is excellent. their prices are higher than some places, but you are paying for quality at madewell. i will always look her first for jeans."
"this is a review for their shoes, which i love. specifically, the d' orsay heel in tan. it's suede, which i love but tends to get dirty faster than other types of uppers made with a different material, like leather. that said, it's a great shoe. it fits nicely and is super comfortable for a heel. i love that it's not too high, but also not too low. great for work and dinner."
"i love madewell, but they're a tad pricey. everything is super cute and there's a huge selection. the aesthetic and quality is great for the price but i wish the sizing/fit was more consistent."
"i love madewell! everything from their shoes to their clothes to their jewelry selection, i love their style and the lifestyle they sell. everything's so easy, yet clean, yet slightly feminine. love their quality too. i will definitely be shopping here for a while."
"i love madewell-especially their jewelry and v-neck tissue t-shirts. i have at least six different colors on those shirts! and their jewelry is sturdy, substantial, stylish and has adjustable lengths to ensure it goes with every outfit in my closet!"
"madewell is seriously made well! i especially love their denim. always fits just right and hugs my curves. plus, so comfortable. my style is very casual, but i want quality, classic pieces that will last me a long time. i always find what i’m looking for at madewell."
"madewell is one of those brands that you picture when you think of ""classic americana."" they always have solid, well constructed pieces without too much flair. they are simple in the best way and will lend a touch of class and quiet sophistication to any outfit."
madewell is such a great store and all their clothes are very well made. sometimes i feel as if the clothes are better suited for tall/slim girls but none the less they have great clothes! also if you're a student remember to show them your student id..ya get 10% off!!
"even though i'm petite, i can actually get away with most of their stuff. i love this brand, i bough a couple of transitioning pieces for fall and i'm in love with each one. i really love the style and quality of the clothes. this relationship is meant to stay."
"their name says it all. the quality of the product is above all others, every time. i recently purchased a pair of jeans from madewell and it's nearly impossible to wear any others now! they fit right, they're flattering, and so comfortable! everyone needs a pair!"
the clothes is gorgeous but a little boxey sometimes.   it seems that it does go on sale and can be quite affordable. i shop here in the fall to get some quality warm pieces. they have very traditional yet on trend type of pieces if that is what you are looking for.
"madewell is my favorite store. it's exactly what you would want from jcrew, except they made an entire sister store and the clothes fit 1000x better. the products are great. i love the seasons shoes and bags that they have. i love that they started monogramming products and have an insider club that you can join for free shipping, monogramming, and other perks."
"i love madewell! they have the best jeans and the best basics! i don't shop here all that often, because i hardly have the time to shop, but when i do they have the greatest service, organization, and loyalty program ever! i love it here and hope you will too!"
i mean if i could buy the whole store i would! they just have the most beautiful pieces if clothing and amazing accessories that just never go out of style. i shop here as often as i can and i always come away this something. there pieces are just timeless!
"i am in love with the jeans from madewell! they have them in an insane number of washes and styles, and they have different fits so they work for people of different builds. i haven't tried many of their other clothes, but their jewelry is also super cute!"
an overall amazing store! have been going there since forever. the trends there are everlasting and are always current. just bought a great quality purse from the store for $129. also has really cute shoes that are great for an la girl. gotta love madewell.
madewell has found the perfect american twist on the classic french girl inspiration. their jeans come from great denim mills and always fit perfectly. their styles are classic and effortless. they do great partnerships and have bags that will last for years.
"madewell has an incredible selection of jeans and i can always find the perfect fit. my favorite purchase is a pair of dark wash jeans and i shop here all the time. the jeans are semi-pricey, but they are great quality so i 100% recommend shopping here."
"one of my favorite stores to browse and purchase clothes from! the clothes just fits my style! it is laidback, yet clean. i love the look of the polished tops and casual denim jeans. i love the quality of the jeans and tops as well. definitely a must go place!"
this store has some of the cutest clothes! always has something i want/need. their pants and jeans are the best! they aren't lying when they say they have the best jeans! they last for forever! i finally got one of these stores up the street from me :)
my favorite clothing store hands down. i am in this store in nyc multiple times during the week due to their excellent sales and deals. everything they sell is top notch from denim to leather to jewelry all at extremely affordable prices for the quality!
"madewell has such a lovely aesthetic. i appreciate their trendsetting styles and their laidback approach to fashion. their clothing is definitely simple but that is what i like. they also make pieces that go well together, to help simplify your wardrobe."
"i love this store. the quality is really great and they have such cute clothes and bags! the price is a little more than some other brands, but buying these pieces is an investment. i love the classic pieces that i have from them that will last me for years!"
"madewell is one of my favorite stores. it is definitely on the expensive side, but the quality matches the price. they have a great mix of classic and trendy items. it's a great place to invest in clothing you know you'll be able to wear a long time."
"madewell! cutest ever! i love love love everything i see, it's just soooo expensive. if the clothes were a bit cheaper i would be all over this place. that being said, the quality actually is pretty great, and i've never had an issue with purchases."
"i usually sew most of my own clothes, but madewell carries a lot of styles with really unique textiles and interesting designs that i'm constantly drawn to. the prices are reasonable and become even more reasonable when there are substantial sales. i love their leather goods like their purses and boots, which have held up really well over the years."
"hands down madewell has the best jeans on the market. so soft, so stretchy, so comfortable. they are expensive so i don't purchase products too often, but when i do the quality is excellent and i have never had to return a product. love madwell!"
"madewell always has such cute clothes! i'm a huge fan of their style, it's trendy and clean cut. i can always find something i love and can't live without in my closet. their items can be a bit expensive though, for the simplicity of the styles."
favorites! i love madewell style and quality! i love shopping in madewell stores moats always the way customer service and no pressure. no room for improvement for me and store are always good quality. all my friends so go shopping in madewell.
this is one of my favorite stores. i especially love the denim and sweaters. everything i've bought has been excellent quality and i've always had wonderful service when shopping.
"madewell can be so expensive, but i'm willing to splurge there. their jeans are amazing. i had no idea how great of a fit they were until my friend told me about them. i'm definitely going to start shopping there for jeans more because i've been disappointed in 7 for all mankind lately."
"one work... jeans! they make amazing jeans that fits so well! it's almost like they were made for you (at least that is how i feel). if that isn't good enough, they also last a long time. they do not show the wear and tear that i out them through."
i recently bought a great necklace at madewell that looks very expensive but goes with everything. i wear it all the time and get compliments. their jewelry is priced well yet it's very fashionable. i would recommend madewell for many items.
"i love madewell. their products, are well, made well! the prices are a bit high but from what i understand it's worth the money. i have only made one purchase, some jewelry, and was very happy with the entire transaction. i love their styles."
only a few steps up from their paren't brand j.crew since their quality has plummeted quite as much. i still think their products are overpriced and the clothes are oddly cut but at least they don't fall apart or start to wear out as easily.
"i love their clothing, but their jeans don't fit my body well unfortunately! i'm tall and thin and they just don't sit well. i do love their t shirts and button up tops though!"
i like madewell and its cozy laid back style. i made my first purchase last weekend when they had a sale and i was quite pleased. some sizes are larger than it is and the prices are slightly higher than others but i would shop there again
a madewell just came into the mall near me. i've bought 2 pairs of jeans from them and i love them. they didn't stretch out so they actually look good on me. i think there tops might be a bit over priced but the jeans are right on point.
i love madewell! the service was great when i went and they have the best jeans ever. they’re so comfortable and stretchy. i got the high waisted and they hold everything and are super flattering. i will definitely continue to shop here.
i love madewell. this is my favorite store for everyday outfits. i have clothes that i can wear to work but also weekend-wear. you really can't beat the sales at madewell and they let you apply multiple discounts to their clothing items!
after hearing so much about how comfortable their clothes are i had to go to their store when it open up. i'm so glad i did. their staff is very helpful and friendly and i'm proud to say the clothes are just as comfortable as i was told they are.
"by far my favorite store, i mean the name says it all. i love the minimalistic look of there clothes. i also love there purses and shoes, most things are made of leather. everything in this store is so beautiful and i want everything lol."
high quality staples for your closet. great black and whites and neutrals i love their t shirts and jeans. i have also seen some
"it seems like madewell can never go wrong! everything always fits well and is flattering. the quality is really great and if you shop the sale section, you can find some really great deals. it's definitely my favorite clothing store!"
my most favorite place to get jeans ever!!!! the quality of everything in this store is amazing. last week i bought my newest favorite pair of jeans—
i recently got a few pairs of jeans from madewell and so far i'm very impressed. they are a little bit on the pricey side but jeans are a staple piece that i think you should spend a little bit more on. a little bit on the trendy side.
they have the best jeans. one of the only stores where i can find size 23. love it. one thing i don't love are the prices but a good pair of jeans is worth investing in. also they usually have really cute stuff in the sale section.
pricey but the quality of clothing is great. i have finally found my favorite basic tees called the whisper tee. so comfortable and cozy! if you shop online and sign up for their free insiders club you get free shipping and free returns!
"really great quality denim jeans, chambray shirts, leather boots, sweaters. products are a little overpriced for mainly basics or layering pieces. worth it for their jeans"
hands down my favorite store. i'm absolutely obsessed with madewell. their jeans are expensive but i've never been disappointed with a purchase. worth it! (could definitely use some more sales though... or a store credit card!!!)
great quality clothes. i love this store. my favorite thing is there sweaters and outwear. my favorite is a jacket i got there that i wear all the time. the only thing i wish is that it was more affordable so i could buy everything!!
"i got a madewell dress recently and it quickly went from a new purchase to my favorite dress i own. it’s black, white and stiped all over and was extra kind to my budget. their clothes are amazing quality and fit even better."
i love anything and everything i have ever bought from madewell. the clothing is so high quality and feels so soft. my favorite purchases from madewell have been some plain or casual tees. i wear them practically everyday.
this is definitely one of my favorite stores. i love their leather goods and their dresses the most. my leather tote is my favorite purchase ever. i would love to see more prints and i will definitely be shopping here again
"great products that last forever. i have a leather purse i got 6 years ago and i loved it so much i bought a second one to trade it out. amazing quality- a little on the expensive side, but all for a good reason. worth it."
i love madewell and aside from heir outerwear (very thin) i would say overall it's really lovely quality and i always walk away feeling like i've gotten something i can wear for a while and won't go out of style immediately.
"i went to madewell for the first time about 4 years ago. i loved the simple and chic style, although i sometimes feel it is a bit over-priced for what it is. i wish there was one in the milwaukee, wi area for me to go to!"
this simple style is my favorite. however the prices in my opinion do not reflect the quality. the jeans are amazing but other clothing items such as shirts should be priced lower. however i keep coming back and shopping!
"i love shopping at madewell. the store is always clean and put together. their displays always draw me in.  their clothing is always high quality and on trend, but the price point is very high. they do have great sales though."
"i love shopping at madewell. their items are a little pricey, but they are great quality! madewell and j. crew are owned by the same company, so they have many similar items, but i feel that madewell is targeted toward a younger crowd. like j. crew, they do offer a discount for teachers, which is nice!"
i love all the clothes at madewell. they're all super great quality and timeless styles. i recently bought the fleet jacket on a whim and i'm pretty satisfied with it and am sure i will be using it for years from now.
i love madewell and the selection of things they offer. i can all league find a unique and cute pieces every single time i go into their store or so online. their pieces always hold up and are always worth the price
madwell is my go to store for jean shorts. i'm 5'11 so lots of jean shorts are very revleaving from other stores. madwell provides coverage and comfort. they also give student discounts which helps a lot when at check out!!
this store man. i love their products so incredibly much. they are well made just like the name lol. their jeans are too notch and i absolutely adore their belts and jewelry.
i love the bohemian and chill vintage vibe madewell always has in their stores. their associates are always so trendy and kind too! i appreciate also how the madewell in ny have great lighting in their fitting rooms.
"madewell is one of my favorite brands to shop. while the price is higher, this is reflected in the quality of the products they sell. the pieces i've purchased are all very versatile and can be dressed up or down."
"madewell tshirts are my favorite!! they are perfect slouchy, trendy, classic!! they are good quality...not thin or flimsy but not thick or boxy.  i have never bought jeans here, but i have many friends who love them"
love the story behind the brand. i love buying chic and bohemian outfits here. always a nice and calming vibe here. my favorite purchase was a pair of dark blue jeans. it is a little expensive but worth the price.
i love the stuff here i buy everything. super chic and also can be hipster if you pair it in fun ways. there are a lot of sales so definitely wait to get a good price on stuff. also student discounts are the best!
this store was a wonderful addition to our local mall.  it provides clothes that are appealing to the over twenty crowd but are not matronly.  they have great promotions and are very affordable but high quality.
great quality clothes but too expensive to go often. if i could pick one store to be my wardrobe it would for sure be madewell. everything there is nice and trendy but also very simple. i wish it wasn't so expensive but i understand it has to be. i will go check out the sales any day.
"madewell is a sister brand of jcrew and their style is also portrayed as the young, bohemian version of jcrew. i find that all of their clothes are way overpriced. their clothes run big, but their jewelery is ironically sized well for petite girls. i wish they had bigger sales like jcrew."
"a little bit on the pricey side, but the quality is wonderful! the shirts have that perfect balance of slouchy but still tailored. i love everything here. and their jewelry selection is on point too! and if you are patient and watch sales and the clearance rack you can score some awesome deals!"
"this place is perfect for wardrobe staples you wear until they are worn out then patch and wear some more. i adore their jeans, shoes, worn tees, jackets, and gift items. pricey but quality without being ostentatious."
"don't shop very often due to price point. however, i'm in love with what i do have. dresses fit amazing and are very flattering.  now have one in town, so excited to go see it. certainly will shop again."
i have only visited this store a few times because there is not one close to wear i live. they have very cute and stylish clothing. everything i have purchased from here has not shown any wear or tear.
"madewell is one of my favorite places to shop. thier statement pieces are super cute. it's a little pricey, but with student, military, teacher, etc discount, sales, and clearance, you can get great deals!"
"this place is the holy grail for denim! their styles are so simplistic and easy that i want to buy the entire store, but sadly they are expensive but you can never spend too much money on a good pair of denim!"
"simple, classic and - as the name indicates - made well! i love their pieces - they are just so classic! you can feel good about investing in a piece because it won't be out of style - love love love!!"
"another one of my favs! great place to shop basics but you can find some unique pieces for a good price. the store associates are always helpful. i’m in madewell at least once a month, just to browse."
"expensive, but so worth it! i have bought their cotton whisper t-shirts and they have kept their shape and are still soft. my favorite purchase of last summer. i wouldn't recommend drying the shirts. i will keep shopping as long as their products are well made."
i absolutely love madewell and all the clothing they sell but it is a little out of my price range. i try to find the maxwell brand at discount stores like the rack to make it more affordable.
excellent quality denim. i have had the same pair of jeans for over a year and they are as good as new! make sure to follow washing instructions on shirts as they may shrink if not washed properly.
i recently purchased their purse at nordstroms. the unique color of orange/rust is what initially caught my attention. then the simplicity of the design. i would purchase more of their products.
madewell is like j crews cute slightly hipster sister brand. this is a great store for jeans and other basic essentials. the leather goods here are also very nice for the price point. the jewelry is super fun and not too over the top. very cute aesthetic in this store.
very trendy well made clothing. is a little pricey so i like to find great of deals on sale items. but every item i've purchased here are expertly detailed and classic in style. looks expensive.
"great store, some of the dresses run long if you are on the shorter side but they have other great merchandise directed at a more young adult demographic. bring your college id in for 15% off!"
"i really like the styles at madewell, but i have to wait until the things i like go on sale! their simple items i think are too expensive, so i usually look for this brand at nordstrom rack."
madewell is the best place to shop. their denim fits my legs perfectly because they're stretchy and hit at the ankle. not to mention their t shirts are bomb and are made with the best quality.
"super comfortable american made clothes! cute yet very simple, the fabrics will make you go crazy in love. fits to regular size chart. a bit pricey but for the price these clothes, with good care last a good few years :) they also make fabulous jewelry as well."
i really enjoy the aesthetics of this store!  i always have a hard time deciding what to buy-- i love it all! the prices tend to be a little steep. i wish they had more sales/promotions.
"overpriced for name brand clothing, but has the basics and essentials needed for any wardrobe. you can find this styled clothing anywhere else for cheaper... like target, old navy, etc."
"i love the look of this store and they have some really great accessories, some of my favorite earrings are from madewell. i just wish they had larger sizes... i'm not a svelte as i used to be"
madewell denim is my favorite. you can get anything hemmed in store for free and they usually run a deal where you can exchange old pants and receive 10-15% off your new jean purchase.
"i have three pair of jeans from madewell that are 2 years old and they still look as good as the day i purchased them. no fading, no stretching and no wearing!! they are amazing jeans."
"such a cute store! sometimes this can be a hit or miss for me, particularly since my job doesn't really allow for the cute fashion-forward prints that are largely used here.  however, i love that these clothes look classic but fresh at the same time."
"the store is kind of pricey, but their jeans are totally worth it. their skinny jeans don't stretch out too much like other jeans do. also, they offer free hemming in their stores."
"i love madewell! the aesthetic/style of their clothing is absolutely gorgeous and the clothes are very high quality. their stuff can be pricy but if you wait for it to go on sale, it's reasonable."
madewell makes some of my favorite classic items. i'm shocked that more people haven't heard of them or shop with them on a regular basis. i will keep going back again and again.

the store is great for basics. i love their tips but i usually can’t buy their bottoms because i’m curvy and their bottoms are for straight waisted people.

i love madewell! definitely a splurge for me but they have the best stuff! so trendy and cute!

i bought one of my favorite pairs of jeans from madewell. they are so flattering in all the places you need and are very high quality

"madewell is literally my favorite clothing store on the planet! it’s a little pricey, but definitely worth saving up for. the clothing is amazing quality that lasts for forever, i’ve had a shirt from them for over 6 years!"
madewell is like jcrew’s cute little sister who is more in on the fashion trends. the clothes are definitely for teens or young adults but the quality is amazing. every time that i have been the workers have been eager to help pick out an outfit!
too expensive but the quality and look of everything here makes me a blind follower to them!
i really like the clothing from this brand. very good quality and large variety of colors and sizes.
i recently bought jeans from here and they turned out very well! they fit perfect and we’re good quality

madewell is one of my favorite stores ever. i am obsessed with the fall/winter lines. the quality is amazing and everything lasts incredibly long. i love their neck scarves and earrings. i will definitely shop there again.
great place to get denim; when their stuff goes on sale it's more affordable (and a lot of it is still very cute).
my favorite store. can find everything i need i’m there and can also spend waaaay to much money at one time. the jeans are the only kind that fit me perfectly.
love the clothes and style! it does pain me to spend so much on clothes and have run into some poorer quality pieces.
their items are a little on the pricey side but quality >> quantity. i absolutely love their jeans and out of all the jeans i have tried they are the most flattering.
my all time favorite brand ever! great quality and super cute!!!!!! good prices for what you get :) i always feel so cute wearing them.
i have a few pieces from madewell. they are classics and they are 'made well' ha! i think the brand is fine. they aren't overpriced.
these clothes are so good. you can usually find them used online and it’s good to check poshmark first before buying them new. the quality is good and they hold up well.
one of my top five favorite stores!! the only issue i have is that it’s on the more expensive side. all of the pieces in the store can be mixed and matched with one another so it’s a great place to shop for a capsule closet.
"my sister works at madewell, so we have fallen in love with their merchandise. a good chunk of my closet has now turned into a madewell rack. the prices seem a bit extreme for some things, but you can find great things on sale and paying full price is worth it sometimes! the products are so well made and adorable and can be dressed up or down. you won’t be disappointed purchasing something from here."
i love madewell! i’ve made very few purchases from the store but love looking through their clothes and their instagram feed.
i have a love hate with their v neck t-shirt’s.   i have some from last year i still wear and love.  i bought 2 new ones this year and they have holes in them almost immediately.  they are more sheer and see through than the previous version.
madewell is one of my favorite places to shop. they are very up to date with their styles. lots of colorful patterns! have a great teacher and student discount!
i love madewell ! they’re products are fantastic! i definitely recommend shopping here !
great basics! i love their white tees here. the cotton is so soft and the material falls nicely when tucked in
adore this store. they are a bit pricier but often they have sales or discounts available to use
"this is a great store, cute clothes and great fitting jeans. a little on the expensive side but they are clothes that last!"
their jeans are so soft and literally made well. kinda pricey but you never regret the purchase. their jewelry is always on point as well! wish it was more affordable. the clothes fit me well and are extremely comfortable.
this store has the best jeans ever i wont ever buy my jeans anywhere else! they are a little pricey but its worth itb
madewell makes really cute clothes though it is a little expensive. they have good quality jeans that are worth the price but i always have to try them on because sometimes they’re randomly tight in the thigh area. i love their totes and accessories though!
quality of their clothes is great. bought a pair of overalls that i wear constantly. but they are very expensive. sometimes i think over priced for what they’re actually selling which is why i had to give them 4 stars instead of 5.
"i purchased two hair bandanas from madewell and i instantly fell in love and will be ordering more! the price is great for the quality and the prints are just too cute! everyone has been complimenting my hair and asking where they can find my bandanas, definitely recommend."
"i can not express how much i love your jeans. i have a figure that is not very suitable to wear and these pants stretch with me without being annoying during the day. i like being able to bring your products madewell is one of my favorite clothing brands. for the most part, i think they are very well made. i love their clothes and their styles."
test360 i have to be at the top of the list of the list of the list of the list of the list of the list of the list of the
"they are a nice cut, but they don't last any longer than any other t"
"my absolute favorite pair of jeans is from madewell! the quality and simplistic look of their line is amazing and so cute! also, my favorite star earrings that i always get compliments on are from madewell! every young adult should shop here!"
"i have only bought t-shirts but i love them, the fabric its nice, i use them with jeans and a sweater, or a blazer, they are soft and great quality, they last long and are affordable! really good brand!"
"we don't have madewell here in canada. so i was *really* excited to shop their store in miami last fall. i purchased 2 v-neck t shirts (white and navy), and one 3/4 length sleeve ribbed knit crew neck knit in burgundy."
"madewell seemed a bit pricey for me at first since tops can range for around $72ea and around $40ea with a sale if you get lucky. :)) but nonetheless, the quality of their items are superb. you can feel that they don't scrimp on the materials when you wear the clothes so i'd say the price is worth it. i even like the leather satchel-type bag that i purchased from them. classic pieces that you can use many times over. :)"
well i’ve only had one shopping experience with madewell! i bought a pair of jeans online! very cute button fly black skinny jeans! i get a lot of compliments on them and they fit great! they just got a rip in the back pocket and the stitching is coming undone which for the amount i paid is kind of irritating! regardless of that though i still love them and would definitely purchase from them again
"i really like madewell's clothes... however, i'm giving it four stars only because their quality is alright and their designs are nice and simple and casual but i just simply think its way too expensive for what you're getting. they do have a student discount though."
"i absolutely love this store! such classic, timeless pieces but always fashionable and well fitted.  everything from their blouses to their dresses is effortlessly chic, minimalist and has that throw on a go vibe.  totally obsessed with everything that comes into this store and all the collaborations they've done with other brands!"
"i love, love, love all of madewell's fashion, and especially their jeans are close to being something along the lines of the love of my legs life. i have never been had any problems with the quality of any of their products, and generally just have absolutely nothing bad to say about the brand. defiantly a brand worth recommending."
madewell has classy and classic clothing for young women with a trendy twist. this is the best place to shop when you want to look cute but appropriate. they don’t cater to all body types and it’s definitely more of a preppy look but if preppy isn’t your style you can still find some great pieces in this shop.
love the boho/ indie vibe this store gives me. i always end of finding the best everyday essential pieces here. i’m obsessed with their plain white tees and they’re high quality jeans. they also have the most darling earrings to make your simple outfit have a pop of fun.
"my all time favourite store. i love this brand from their products, to social media, photographs everything about this brand it brilliant. i have a few of their products are they are all really good quality and really well made. a must on any shopping trip"
madewell has recently extended their size range. which is great. but they could have done a lot more. just from a business stand point i don’t understand why any brand doesn’t make sizes past a 12-14. id love to shop here more.
this is my favorite apparel store in the states! it's a good plave to find classic pieces for ypur wardrobe. just be prepared to spend a pretty penny because it's not affordable...
madewell has some really nice and in style clothing items as well as accessories. i got a nice skirt and top and cute chunky necklace for slightly more than i wanted to lay but it is really great quality. still wear those items alot!
love the madewell brand.
"i absolutely love madewell, it fits my style perfectly as it has a lot of laid back pieces but also some smarter pieces i can wear everyday to work or out for a nice dinner. the price point is high but i feel like the quality of the clothing, shoes and hand bags is very high. i tend to shop mostly in their sales and get some great items at good prices. they have been running a lot of promotions recently with 30-40% extra off the sale prices so this brings $120 shirts down to $59 or so. i bought a great sweater that was $140 originally for $59. it is all wool and so thick so it's super warm. i also shop at the memphis store mainly and i love the selection they have there. staff are also so friendly. when i found an item i liked but wasn't in my size, they ordered it for me from another store and had it shipped to my house for free, this was also a sale item. it arrived in two business days!"
"madewell is one my favorite brands! the boyfriend high waisted jeans cannot be beat, and their colors do not fade. my one criticism is that it is very expensive, so i only really go there to treat myself."
"wish they had this in canada! but i love their leather goods, very well made, and their accessories. shoes are always in style and very comfortable and again, in love with their jewellery section."
this is my favorite store! its a bit expensive but the quailty is totally worth it. my favorite pieces are the black jean skirt i have and a few shirts i have from there as well.
love the leather bags.  they have lasted me for a very long time and look beautiful even after many years.  i use my tote heavily but the leather remains smooth and supple.  i recommend this brand to all of my friends!
great styling and classic fashion and jeans. i love the quirky accessories and that i was able to have my purse monogrammed for free. a lovely touch of personality!
we don't have stores in canada (or not near montreal at least) so i discovered it in nyc. i bought a dress that i like but also sunglasses that kind of looks like rayban ones except that i paid $50 for them. i can't wait to go back!
"i love going into madewell stores, but i also feel it is a love-hate relationship. it's a hit or miss for me most of the time. i pick up a lot of items and may notice something about one that has a small detail that turns me away. but, overall their aesthetic is to die for and their denim is definitely a winner!"
"love the brand, but i find they have adopted their sister store's methods of overpricing items...but, i've never found a better v-neck tee. just can't afford to buy it anymore with the canada/us exchange rate."
"madewell offers great basics and simple shapes, however it's a challenge for me because to make online clothing purchases the garment has to be something special and jump off the screen especially because i can't try it on before i place my order."
i really like madewell's clothing especially the dresses and jeans but its just so expensive that as a student i'm just not sure it's worth it if you don't have the money.
"hands down, one of my favourite stores! it’s pricier but the clothes last. i was hesitant when i purchased my overall jeans but they’ve been very good to me!"
love their stuff! they've really become super popular in a small amount of time!! their stuff is super cute but i do feel that they are on the pricey side.
you need lots of time for shopping here as there is lots of selection.  the sales staff help you to find the sizes and accessories to complete the outfit.
this is my ultimate go to brand. the quality is amazing for the price point. the comfort is beyond what you could ever imagine. i love this brand.
"when it comes to shoes, i always trust madewell! their sizing is super accurate so i’m confident purchasing online and the quality is fanatic!!"
"madewell has amazing styles, but they are very expensive, especially for canadians paying shipping, duty, and with a bad exchange rate."
they made my favorite denim shorts! they fit so well i had to buy the two colors they made. their jewelry and leather pieces are amazing too.
i am fascinated by this type of thing for precisely occasions where you can use and appreciate very good quality and perfect attention
love the simple designs at madewell and i know that the items will hold up far better than other mass produced clothing retailers
so overpriced !!! uggh  the clothing looks so cute & clean cut classic styles but so pricey i don't want to purchase form it :(
nice store with some average classic/timeless pieces. i prefer their sales since the regular pricing can be a bit high.
i love their simple casual style and their monogrammed items. their leather goods are stylish and go with everything.
unique design. nice materials. i personally think it's a bit overpriced. wait for sales promotions to stock up.
always something beautiful to find. perfect place to find staple pieces to build your wardrobe around for the season.
great quality and adorable styles! all of their stuff will last you a long time and isn't difficult to take care of
great clothes with amazing selections and fit! tends to be a bit pricey sometimes but they have amazing sales!
quality is okay for the prices. i just buy used madewell items or if they are having a sale on clearance items.
"i love their denim, casual clothing and jewelry! one of my favorite brands. i loveeee going to their stores!"
"best jeans, best basics. love their linen/cotton pieces and the simplicity that works do every age."
"great stuff to use, amazing thing to receive.. its truly amazing and elegant.. im loving it."
